      <birthName>Jr., Leslie Lynch King</birthName>
      <biography>Gerald Rudolph Ford was the 38th President of the United States from August 1974 until January 1977.  Ford was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska as Leslie Lynch King, Jr., being the son of Leslie Lynch King and Dorothy Ayer Gardner King. His parents separated two weeks after his birth and his mother took him to Grand Rapids, Michigan to live with her parents. On February 1, 1916, his mother Dorothy King married Gerald R. Ford, a paint salesman. The Fords began calling their son Gerald R. Ford, Jr. but this name became legal only on December 3, 1935. Aged 13, Ford knows that Gerald Ford Sr., was not his biological father, but it lasted until 1930 he met his biological father Leslie King, who made an unexpected stop in Grand Rapids.  Ford grew up in a family with three younger half-brothers (Thomas, Richard, and James). He attended South High School in Grand Rapids, where he already showed is athletics skills, being named to the honor society and the &quot;All-City&quot; and &quot;All-State&quot; football teams. As a scout he was ranked Eagle Scout in November 1927. He earned money by working in the family paint business and at a local restaurant.  Ford attended The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor from 1931 to 1935. He majored in economics and political science and graduated with a B.A. degree in June 1935. He played on the University&apos;s national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933 and was voted MVP of Wolverine in 1934. He also played in All-Star and benefit football games. He denied offers from two professional football teams, (Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers), but chose to become boxing coach and assistant varsity football coach at Yale hoping to attend law school there. Ford earned his law degree in 1941.  After returning to Michigan and passing his bar exam, Ford set up a law partnership in Grand Rapids with Philip Buchen, a University of Michigan fraternity brother (who later served on Ford&apos;s White House staff as Counsel to the President).  In April 1942 Ford joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and became a physical fitness instructor at a flight school in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In the spring of 1943 he began service in the light aircraft carrier USS Monterey. Ford spent the remainder of the war ashore and was discharged as a lieutenant commander in February 1946. He returned to Grand Rapids to become a partner in the locally prestigious law firm of Butterfield, Keeney, and Amberg.  His first political experience was in the summer of 1940 when he was working in the presidential campaign of Wendell Willkie. Six years later he decided to challenge Bartel Jonkman for the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1948 election. Ford won the nomination and after that was elected to Congress on November 2, 1948, receiving 61% of the vote.  On October 15 1948, the height of the campaign, Ford married Elizabeth (&apos;Betty&apos;) Anne Bloomer Warren, a department store fashion consultant. Betty was born on April 8, 1918 in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in Grand Rapids. They subsequently had four children: Michael Gerald (March 14, 1950), John Gardner (March 16, 1952), Steven Meigs (May 19, 1956) and Susan Elizabeth (July 6, 1957).  Ford served in the House of Representatives from January 3, 1949 to December 6, 1973. He was re-elected twelve times, winning each time with more than 60% of the vote. As his ambition was to become Speaker of the House already in the early 1950s, he denied offers to run for both the Senate and the Michigan governorship in these years. In 1961 he became chairman of the House Republican Conference. In 1963 President Johnson appointed Ford to the Warren Commission to investigate the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was the last living member of the Warren Commission.  In 1965 Ford was chosen as the House minority leader, a post he held until 1973. As minority leader Ford made more than 200 speeches a year all across the country, which made him nationally known. He was not only a close friend of Richard Nixon for many years, but also a loyal supporter in both the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. As in 1960, Ford was again considered as a vice presidential candidate in 1968. Because the Republicans did not attain a majority in the House, Ford was unable to reach his ultimate political goal, Speaker of the House. Instead, he became president of the Senate.  Late in 1973 Spiro Agnew pleaded no contest to a charge of income tax evasion and resigned as Vice President. President Nixon was empowered by the 25th Amendment to appoint a new vice president and chose Ford. He was sworn in on December 6, 1973.  On August 9, 1974, Nixon became the first president in U.S. history to resign from the office under the threat of impeachment in the Watergate scandal. The same day Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office as 38th President of the United States on August 9, 1974. Also in August 1974, Ford nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, which nomination was confirmed by Congress on December 19, 1974.  One month after taking office President Ford faced one of the toughest decisions in his career. He decided to grant Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon for all offences against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in. The public opinion was mostly negative about the pardon and there was even suspicion Ford and Nixon had made a deal to grant a pardon if Nixon would resign. Although this happened on September 8, 1974, it might have cost the re-election of Ford two years later.  On November 24, 1974, in the conference hall of the Okeansky Sanitarium, Vladivostok, USSR, President Ford and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev signed the SALT-treaty, following talks on the limitation of strategic offensive arms  In March 1975, during the final days of the Vietnam War, Ford ordered the airlift of about 237,000 Vietnamese refugees to the United States. Two months later, on May 14, 1975, Ford ordered U.S. forces to retake the S.S. Mayaguez after its seizure by Cambodia, an action Ford characterized as an &quot;act of piracy.&quot; The operation saved the ship&apos;s 39-member crew, but sadly 41 Americans were killed and 50 more wounded during the preparation and execution of the rescue.  President Ford was twice the target of assassination attempts. Both took place in on two separate trips to California in September 1975 and both were &apos;performed&apos; by women. On September 5, 1975 he survived an assassination attempt in Sacramento, California, by Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, a member of a cult once led by convicted mass murderer Charles Manson. On September 22, 1975, in San Francisco, California, Sara Jane Moore fired a shot at the president, but a bystander diverted the shot.  Despite his former athletics skills, Gerald Ford tumbled several times during his presidency. No cause was ever communicated.  At the Republican National Convention in August 1976, Ford fought off a serious challenge from Californian Governor Ronald Reagan to be nominated as his party&apos;s presidential candidate. He chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate.  Although he succeeded in closing in on Democrat Jimmy Carter&apos;s large lead in the polls, President Ford finally lost one of the closest elections in history in November 1976.  After leaving office, Gerald and Betty Ford returned to private life and moved to California where they built a new house in Rancho Mirage, which became his last residence.  President Ford continued to actively participate in the political process and to speak out on important political issues. He lectured at hundreds of colleges and universities.  In 1981, the Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were dedicated.  President Ford was the recipient of numerous awards and honors by many civic organizations, like the recipient of many honorary Doctor of Law degrees from various public and private colleges and universities.  In August 1999, President Bill Clinton presented Ford with the nation&apos;s highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom. Two months later, in October 1999, Senate and House leaders presented Ford and his wife, Betty, with the Congressional Gold Medal. Together with former President Carter, he served as honorary Co-Chair of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001. In May 2001 he was presented with the Profiles in Courage award for his controversial decision to pardon former President Nixon.  In August 2000 Ford suffered a mild stroke while attending the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On May 16, 2003 following fluctuations in blood pressure and hot weather, Ford suffered dizzy spells on the golf course and taken to hospital. He was released the next day.  Although President Ford cut back on his travel and public appearances in recent years, he attended funeral services for President Ronald Reagan at Washington&apos;s National Cathedral, sitting with former Presidents Clinton, Bush and Carter, and their wives in June 2004.  In August 2006, he was discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, after doctors tried to reduce or eliminate blockages in his coronary arteries. They also implanted a pacemaker to improve his heart performance. In the fall of 2006 Ford spent several days at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage for medical tests. He was released on October 16.  On November 12, 2006, Ford officially became the longest-lived president, surpassing Ronald Reagan. Ford would extend the record by 45 days.  On December 26, 2006 at 6:45 p.m., President Ford died in his house in Rancho Mirage, California. He was aged 93 years and 165 days old, making him the longest-lived United States President. No cause of death was communicated. A state funeral and memorial services were held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. on January 2, 2007. President Ford was buried at his presidential museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  President Gerald Ford is survived by his wife Betty, after more than 58 years of marriage, and by their four children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his brother, Richard, of Grand Rapids, Michigan.</biography>

She also has a brother, Richard Field. Sally attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California.  Her acting career began in 1965, when she landed the role of Frances Elizabeth &apos;Gidget&apos; Lawrence in _&quot;Gidget&quot; (1965)_ (qv); it was canceled after only one season because of bad ratings. She went on to star in _&quot;The Flying Nun&quot; (1967)_ (qv), which ran for three seasons. She also appeared in her first film in 1967, _The Way West (1967)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Kirk Douglas (I)&apos; (qv). In the next few years she appeared in numerous TV movies and TV shows such as _Maybe I&apos;ll Come Home in the Spring (1971) (TV)_ (qv), _Marriage: Year One (1971) (TV)_ (qv), _&quot;The Girl with Something Extra&quot; (1973)_ (qv), and _&quot;Sybil&quot; (1976)_ (qv). In 1977 she starred alongside &apos;Burt Reynolds (I)&apos; (qv) in the box office hit _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv), which led to a less successful sequel in 1980. In 1979 she starred in the popular film _Norma Rae (1979)_ (qv) and she received her first Oscar for that role.  In the years that followed she starred in films such as _Absence of Malice (1981)_ (qv), _Kiss Me Goodbye (1982)_ (qv), _Places in the Heart (1984)_ (qv) (she received her second Oscar for her role), _Murphy&apos;s Romance (1985)_ (qv), _Punchline (1988)_ (qv) and _Steel Magnolias (1989)_ (qv). In 1993 she starred alongside &apos;Robin Williams (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv) in the popular comedy _Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)_ (qv). A year after, she played the role of &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) character&apos;s mother (even though she&apos;s only ten years older than he is in real life) in the film _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv). The film was a huge commercial success and won six Academy awards.  Since then she has appeared in TV movies and miniseries such as _&quot;A Woman of Independent Means&quot; (1995)_ (qv), _Merry Christmas, George Bailey (1997) (TV)_ (qv), _&quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1998)_ (qv) and _David Copperfield (2000) (TV)_ (qv).

She also appeared in 12 episodes of _&quot;ER&quot; (1994)_ (qv) from 2000 to 2006. In recent years she has played the role of matriarch Nora Walker in the hit television show _&quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; (2006)_ (qv), which earned her an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2007.  Sally has been married twice, first to Steven Craig from 1968 to 1975. They had two sons together, &apos;Peter Craig (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Eli Craig&apos; (qv). Her second marriage was to film producer &apos;Alan Greisman&apos; (qv) from 1984 to 1993. They had one son together, Samuel Greisman (born December 2, 1987).</biography>

      <biography>Vin Diesel was born in New York City. He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager, in an artist&apos;s housing project in New York&apos;s Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin&apos;s fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age 17 and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York&apos;s hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.  Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called &quot;Feature Films at used Car Prices&quot; by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.  Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, _Strays (1997)_ (qv). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) was impressed by _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) earned Vin more work, when the director of _The Iron Giant (1999)_ (qv) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin&apos;s career has steadily grown, with him securing his first lead role as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film _Pitch Black (2000)_ (qv). That role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.</biography>

      <birthName>Dern, Bruce MacLeish</birthName>
      <biography>Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies&apos; premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on.  &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under &apos;Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos; (qv). When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well.  Some critics said that &quot;Gatsby&quot; would have been better if Dern rather than &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv) had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson&apos;s brother in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in &quot;Coming Home,&quot; a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous &quot;Oscar curse&quot; that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner &apos;Gig Young&apos; (qv), Dern&apos;s co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don&apos;t They? (1969)_ (qv).  Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even &apos;Anthony Perkins (I)&apos; (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before &quot;Coming Home.&quot; He failed, and his career suffered.  Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3 (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star &apos;Maud Adams&apos; (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern&apos;s star was seriously dimmed.  Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of &apos;Jason Miller (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.  Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, &apos;Diane Ladd&apos; (qv), and their daughter, &apos;Laura Dern&apos; (qv), kicked into high gear.  Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema&apos;s premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv) in _The Cowboys (1972)_ (qv), Dern&apos;s career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor&apos;s artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.</biography>

      <biography>Perhaps best remembered for his touching performance as &quot;Bubba&quot; opposite &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) in the Academy Award-winning _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv), Mykelti Williamson is one of the most sought-after actors in Hollywood, who has been steadily honing his craft since he first began acting professionally at the age of 18.  This past fall Williamson starred as Lt. Philip Gerard, the hardnosed detective determined to recapture escaped convict Dr. Richard Kimble (&apos;Tim Daly (I)&apos; (qv)) in CBS&apos; update of the classic 1960&apos;s action series _&quot;The Fugitive&quot; (2000)_ (qv).  The son of an Air Force Staff Sergeant (father) and certified public accountant (mother), Williamson was born in St. Louis, MO, and began performing on the stage at the age of 9. Like many youngsters, he was enamored with the concept of television, and thought that the images he was seeing on the small screen were reality. It wasn&apos;t until his mother put him in a church play that he realized that what the people on the small screen were doing was performing. He was instantly hooked. At the age of 15, Williamson and his family settled in Los Angeles. A superb athlete, he excelled at both football and basketball, but the acting bug led him to quit sports and dance with the cheerleading squad, much to the chagrin of his coaches.  Following graduation, Williamson began acting professionally, making appearances on television shows such as _&quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; (1975)_ (qv), _&quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (1981)_ (qv) and _&quot;China Beach&quot; (1988)_ (qv), among others. He made his film debut in the &apos;Walter Hill (I)&apos; (qv)-directed feature _Streets of Fire (1984)_ (qv), opposite &apos;Diane Lane (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Michael Paré&apos; (qv) and &apos;Willem Dafoe&apos; (qv).  He would subsequently appear in the feature _The First Power (1990)_ (qv) with &apos;Lou Diamond Phillips&apos; (qv), _Miracle Mile (1988)_ (qv) with &apos;Anthony Edwards (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Mare Winningham&apos; (qv), _Number One with a Bullet (1987)_ (qv), _Wildcats (1986)_ (qv) and _Free Willy (1993)_ (qv).  Following his critically acclaimed performance in _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv), Williamson starred in &apos;Forest Whitaker&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Waiting to Exhale (1995)_ (qv); partnered with &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv) in &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Heat (1995)_ (qv); _Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (1995)_ (qv), and starred alongside &apos;Nicolas Cage&apos; (qv) in _Con Air (1997)_ (qv).  Williamson was also seen in &apos;Mike Nichols (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; political drama _Primary Colors (1998)_ (qv) (a cameo appearance which he did as a personal favor to Nichols and &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv)) and _Three Kings (1999)_ (qv), opposite &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Mark Wahlberg (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ice Cube&apos; (qv).  In 1996 Williamson returned to television when he starred opposite &apos;Delroy Lindo&apos; (qv) and &apos;Blair Underwood&apos; (qv) in the critically acclaimed HBO telefilm _Soul of the Game (1996) (TV)_ (qv) and received rave reviews for his stirring portrayal of legendary Negro League baseball legend &apos;Josh Gibson (I)&apos; (qv). Williamson also starred in _Buffalo Soldiers (1997) (TV)_ (qv) for TNT and _12 Angry Men (1997) (TV)_ (qv) for Showtime, as well as starring in the cable network&apos;s series _&quot;The Hoop Life&quot; (1999)_ (qv).  On stage Williamson starred with &apos;Samuel L. Jackson&apos; (qv), &apos;D.B. Sweeney&apos; (qv), &apos;Ellis Williams&apos; (qv), &apos;Matt McGrath (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Richard Reilly (I)&apos; (qv) in &apos;Clark Gregg&apos; (qv)&apos;s (&quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;) 1995&apos;s ensemble drama &quot;Distant Fires&quot;, which earned the cast a prestigious L.A. Theatre Award.  An avid sports fan and devoted family man, Williamson enjoys restoring classic cars and rodeoing in his free time. He currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two of his three daughters.  Named by his grandfather for &apos;Spirit&apos; or &apos;Silent Friend&apos; in the language of Blackfeet Indians, Mykelti Williamson has quietly built a reputation in Hollywood as one of the most consistently proven actors in the business, delivering stirring and honest performances that always capture audiences.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>1947</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>A veteran of stage, film and television with a variety of characters to his credit, Richard Portnow was named one of the &quot;Actors We Love&quot; from the actors&apos; trade newspaper Back Stage West. It said, &quot;Portnow knows exactly how to hook an audience with every character.&quot; This Brooklyn native has worked steadily for 20 years and has built a solid list of credits, appearing in some of the most highly regarded and successful films and television shows of the past two decades.  His entire family hails from Brooklyn. His folks, Al and Flo, are gone, but he has a brother (Jay), a sister (Gayle), two nephews (John and Sam) and three nieces (Samara, Ilana and Maia). He graduated with a BA degree as a speech and theater major from Brooklyn College. He did not shine while in college, and was discouraged from continuing as an actor with the critique that he was &quot;hopeless and without any ability or talent&quot; (he continues to wonder if the faculty was right). He has been a bartender, an antique dealer, a boxer, an international drug trafficker, a fifth-grade teacher in the NYC public school system, a competitive body builder, a truck driver, a bouncer, a bagel maker, a short-order cook, a marathon runner, a designer, a competitive gymnast, a background extra, a disco dancer at the famed &quot;Arthur&quot; discotheque, and a confused and aimless layabout. Richard is 6&apos;0&quot;, weighs in at a trim 180 lb. and continues to box. He has excellent defensive skills and his ability to stop punches with his face has made him a local favorite.  Portnow assayed the role of attorney Hal &quot;Mel&quot; Melvoin on the Emmy-winning HBO series _&quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999)_ (qv), the lawyer for Uncle Junior, whom he singlehandedly tried to keep out of prison and managed to get himself placed under house arrest instead. His rates for defending Corrado Soprano (Uncle Juniors&apos;s full name) are astronomical, but as Uncle June has said, &quot;Mel, you&apos;re worth every penny&quot;. He has held this role since the show&apos;s inception in 1999.  Richard began his professional career at the famed Cafe La Mama in New York City, appearing in plays by &apos;Tom Eyen&apos; (qv), &apos;Leonard Melfi&apos; (qv), &apos;Jeff Weiss (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Megan Terry (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Tom O&apos;Horgan&apos; (qv) and &apos;Lanford Wilson&apos; (qv). He won &quot;The Best Newcomer of the Year&quot; award from Show Business Magazine as a result of his early work off-off-Broadway. He continued his stage career with starring roles on Broadway in &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; and &quot;A Month of Sundays&quot;. He was in the original cast of &quot;Moonchildren&quot; at the prestigious Royal Court Theatre in London. He has also worked extensively at some of the most highly regarded regional theaters in the country, including The Long Wharf Theater, The Berkshire Theatre Festival for the brilliant director Josephine Abady, The Philadelphia Drama Guild, The Lowell Regional Theater and the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park. &apos;Neil Simon (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Oscar and Felix&quot; at The Geffen Playhouse marked Richard&apos;s Los Angeles stage debut. His has also appeared in &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Writer&apos;s Block&quot;, which was directed by Allen at The Atlantic Theater Company in New York.  Richard has been fortunate and privileged to work with some of the best directors in film today. Among those who have had a profound influence on him are &apos;Barry Levinson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Joel Coen&apos; (qv), &apos;Ethan Coen (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;David Fincher&apos; (qv), Woody Allen, &apos;Sydney Pollack&apos; (qv), &apos;James Foley (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Jim Jarmusch&apos; (qv), &apos;Heywood Gould&apos; (qv), &apos;Cameron Crowe (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sidney Lumet&apos; (qv). He has also appeared as a regular on the critically acclaimed series _&quot;EZ Streets&quot; (1996)_ (qv) and on the police drama _&quot;Ryan Caulfield: Year One&quot; (1999)_ (qv). He has had guest-starring appearances on _&quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1989)_ (qv), _&quot;Mad About You&quot; (1992)_ (qv), _&quot;Going to California&quot; (2001)_ (qv), _&quot;Spin City&quot; (1996)_ (qv), _&quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (1993)_ (qv), _&quot;The Shield&quot; (2002)_ (qv), _&quot;Dave&apos;s World&quot; (1993)_ (qv), _&quot;Civil Wars&quot; (1991)_ (qv), _&quot;Homefront&quot; (1991)_ (qv), _&quot;Double Rush&quot; (1995)_ (qv), _&quot;JAG&quot; (1995)_ (qv), _&quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993)_ (qv), _&quot;The Nanny&quot; (1993)_ (qv), _&quot;Middle Ages&quot; (1992)_ (qv), _&quot;The Commish&quot; (1991)_ (qv) _&quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1987)_ (qv) and _&quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1993)_ (qv).  Richard has also starred in numerous movies of the week and mini series, most notably Neil Simon&apos;s _Laughter on the 23rd Floor (2001) (TV)_ (qv), _Double Bang (2001)_ (qv), _Bella Mafia (1997) (TV)_ (qv), _A Deadly Silence (1989) (TV)_ (qv), _&quot;Original Sin&quot; (1997)_ (qv), _Peter Gunn (1989) (TV)_ (qv) and _Indictment: The McMartin Trial (1995) (TV)_ (qv).  Richard resides in New York and Los Angeles with his feisty English Cocker Spaniel &quot;HeyBoy&quot; and his Chow/German Shepherd &quot;Sweetie&quot;. He is an avid collector of Americana from the 1940s and 1950s, with special focus on the original oil paintings created for the &quot;pulp magazine&quot; covers of the 1930s and 1940s.</biography>

      <biography>Jonathan Pryce was born on June 1, 1947, in Holywell, Wales. His father, named Isaac Price, was a coal miner, who died in 1976. His mother, named Margaret Ellen (nee Williams), was a retail cashier. He left the home of his parents at age 16 to attend an art school, where he became interested in drama. At some point he changed the spelling of his last name from Price to Pryce. He studied acting on a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After graduation from RADA, he joined the Liverpool Everyman Theatre and eventually became its Artistic Director.  In the 1970s Pryce established himself on the London stage with appearances in &apos;The Taming of the Shrew&apos;, &apos;Hamlet&apos;, and &apos;Measure for Measure&apos; among other plays. He won the 1977 Tony Award for his Broadway debut in &apos;Comedians&apos;, for which he also earned the 1977 Theatre World Award and the 1977 nomination for Drama Desk Outstanding Actor Award. Pryce earned his second Tony Award 15 years later for the role as &quot;The Engineer&quot;, a half-Vietnamese/half French pimp in &apos;Miss Saigon&apos;. Pryce created the role in the original London production and agreed to reprise the role on Broadway in a transplant of the same production. Despite controversy over his appearance -- the actors union decried the long-standing practice of hiring white actors to play Asian or Eurasian characters, especially given the paucity of roles for Asian characters, and it also objected to the producer&apos;s refusal to even audition any Asian actors -- he gave a brilliant performance.  In 1976 Pryce made his big screen debut in _Voyage of the Damned (1976)_ (qv). But it wasn&apos;t until 1983 that he made a strong impression with his scary performance as a freaky manipulative Mr. Dark in Ray Bradbury&apos;s _Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983)_ (qv). Pryce shot to fame with _Brazil (1985)_ (qv) and his role as Sam Lowry, a technocrat trying to correct an error caused by a bug and himself becomes entangled in psychopathic bureaucracy eventually becoming an enemy of the state. He also filled such strong and authoritative roles, as president Juan Peron opposite Madonna in _Evita (1996)_ (qv), then co-starred opposite Pierce Brosnan as Elliot Carver, the evil megalomaniac media mogul in the 18th Bond film, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv).  Pryce&apos;s versatility and multifaceted talent rarely had a chance to take him beyond playing freaks and villains in film, an imposed forte which he, however, managed to overcome in his numerous stage performances and in a few film and TV works. He went on playing a range of characters marked with sophistication and depth, such as his subtle and nuanced portrayal of author Lytton Strachey in _Carrington (1995)_ (qv), for which he won the Best Actor Award at Cannes. Pryce also shone in musicals &apos;My Fair Lady&apos; and &apos;Oliver&apos; to name just a few. Pryce made numerous works for television ranging from costume dramas to comedy, and from narrations to singing. In January 2006, he replaced John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson in the acclaimed musical version of &apos;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&apos;. He appeared as the timid Jamaican Governor Wetherby Swann in _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)_ (qv), and the sequel _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&apos;s Chest (2006)_ (qv), and the third installment of the Pirates franchise, _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End (2007)_ (qv).  Jonathan Pryce has been with his partner, actress Kate Fahy, since 1974 when they met at the Everyman Theatre Liverpool Company, though they have never married. They have two sons, Patrick (born 1983) and Gabriel (born 1986), and one daughter, Phoebe (born 1990). Pryce and Fahy also co-starred in the 2004 production of &apos;The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&apos;. Fahy and Pryce reside with their family in England.</biography>

      <biography>Giancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.  He was born August 1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For ten years young Giannini lived and studied in Naples, earning his degree in electronics. At the age of 18 he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art D&apos;Amico in Rome, making his stage acting debut there. His credits included performances in contemporary Italian plays, as well, as in Italian productions of &apos;William Shakespeare (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s plays &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer&apos;s Night Dream&quot;. In 1965 he made his debut on television starring as David Copperfield in the TV mini-series made by RAI, the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen debut in _Libido (1965)_ (qv), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has been in a successful collaboration with the legendary Italian director &apos;Lina Wertmüller&apos; (qv), who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears as peasant Tonino who prepares to assassinate dictator &apos;Benito Mussolini&apos; (qv) in _Film d&apos;amore e d&apos;anarchia, ovvero &apos;stamattina alle 10 in via dei Fiori nella nota casa di tolleranza...&apos; (1973)_ (qv), as a sailor in the irony-laden comedy _Travolti da un insolito destino nell&apos;azzurro mare d&apos;agosto (1974)_ (qv) and as a survivor of a concentration camp in the Oscar-nominated _Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975)_ (qv). He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in &apos;Rainer Werner Fassbinder&apos; (qv)&apos;s masterpiece _Lili Marleen (1981)_ (qv).  Giannini also made a reputation for dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv), &apos;Michael Douglas (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Dustin Hoffman&apos; (qv), &apos;Gérard Depardieu&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ian McKellen&apos; (qv), among others. He received a compliment from &apos;Stanley Kubrick&apos; for his dubbing of Nicholson in _The Shining (1980)_ (qv). Giannini&apos;s fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as _A Walk in the Clouds (1995)_ (qv), _Hannibal (2001)_ (qv), _Darkness (2002)_ (qv) and _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), and reprises the role in the sequel, _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Born in Owensboro but grew up in Drakesboro, Kentucky. His childhood was spent playing sports, hunting and fishing with his father. Occasionally Joel would help out on the family farm but he knew that was not where his future would lead. He always dreamed of being an actor but never thought of it seriously until college. While attending classes at Murray State University he decided that after graduation he would move to Los Angeles. So in the classic story he loaded up his jalopy car and left in the darkness of early morning. Two days later he arrived in Hollywood in July of 2001. After only seven months he landed a part in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) alongside Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hanks and was directed by Steven Spielberg.</biography>

      <biography>Lidia was born in a small town called Backa Palanka located in the northern Vojvodina province of Serbia which you probably couldn&apos;t find on map, so don&apos;t worry about it. Her parents moved to Chicago, IL and planted roots when she was a year old. She graduated from DePaul University in Chicago, IL with a Master&apos;s degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. Shortly after college, she got a really bad case of &quot;Artistic itch&quot; caused by a rash of unrealized potential and dreams. To remedy her affliction she left her job in the corporate world to pursue acting in Chicago. After a couple of successful years working and studying the craft in Chicago, she packed her Mitsubishi Eclipse and drove to Los Angeles to continue scratching. She has been working in various theater, TV, film, and commercial projects since. Things have cleared up nicely if you were wondering, thanks. Lidia has been credited under the names Lidia Sabljic, Lidia Mills, and most recently changed her stage name to Lidia Ryan because she felt like it. Lidia spends her free time with her husband, step son, 2 cats, 2 rabbits and a tortoise.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>16 April 1954</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Barkin, Ellen Rona</birthName>
      <biography>Offbeat, unconventionally pretty, and utterly mesmerizing, Ellen Barkin was born in 1954 of Jewish parentage, the daughter of a chemical salesman and hospital administrator. Raised in the South Bronx and Queens, New York area, she wanted to be an actress as early as her teens and was eventually accepted into Manhattan&apos;s High School of the Performing Arts.  Barkin then attended Hunter College and received her degree after double majoring in history and drama. At one point she wanted to teach ancient history, but instead turned her thoughts back to her first love - acting. Barkin then continued her education at New York&apos;s Actor&apos;s Studio. Fearful of the auditioning process, she studied acting for seven years before finally landing her first audition. While continuing her studies, she worked as a waitress at the avant-garde Ocean Club. Performing off-Broadway in such plays &quot;Shout Across the River&quot; (1979), &quot;Extremities&quot; (1983), &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1984) and &quot;Eden Court&quot; (1985), she was applauded across the board for her first film lead in _Diner (1982)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Mickey Rourke&apos; (qv) and &apos;Daniel Stern (I)&apos; (qv), and pursued sexy tough-cookie status thereafter with such quirky roles in _The Big Easy (1986)_ (qv) starring &apos;Dennis Quaid&apos; (qv) and _Siesta (1987)_ (qv) with Irish actor &apos;Gabriel Byrne&apos; (qv), whom she married in 1987 and separated from in 1993 after producing a son and daughter. She and Byrne divorced in 1999.  With trademark squinting eyes and slightly off-kilter facial features, Barkin continued the fascination of her seamy/steamy girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks status most notably opposite &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv) in the thriller _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv). In addition, she was well cast as &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv)&apos;s abused wife in _This Boy&apos;s Life (1993)_ (qv), and portrayed &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; in _Wild Bill (1995)_ (qv) with earnest. Other impressionable offbeat projects included roles in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)_ (qv), _Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)_ (qv) and _Mercy (2000)_ (qv). On TV, she was well-cast in the mini-movie _Clinton and Nadine (1988) (TV)_ (qv) and won an Emmy award for her gripping performance in _Before Women Had Wings (1997) (TV)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Oprah Winfrey&apos; (qv) as another abused wife who, in this case, turns her violent anger on her own daughters.  In 2000, Barkin married billionaire &apos;Ronald O. Perelman&apos; (qv), eleven years her senior and chairman of the Revlon company, and put her career relatively on hold, appearing sporadically in edgy films like _She Hate Me (2004)_ (qv) and _Palindromes (2004)_ (qv). Barkin and Perelman went through an acrimonious divorce in 2006.  Just prior to her divorce in late 2005, Barkin ventured into independent film production with Applehead Pictures, a company she set up with her brother &apos;George Barkin&apos; (qv), who is a scriptwriter and former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and High Times, and former Independent Film Channel executive &apos;Caroline Kaplan (I)&apos; (qv). In her first major acting appearance since her divorce from Perelman, Barkin co-starred in _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv) with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv), &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv) and former co-star Pacino. She followed up Ocean&apos;s with a supporting role in &apos;Antoine Fuqua&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Brooklyn&apos;s Finest (2009)_ (qv), _Happy Tears (2009)_ (qv) with &apos;Parker Posey&apos; (qv) and &apos;Demi Moore&apos; (qv), and _Twelve (2010)_ (qv).  Recently, Barkin has produced features, including _Letters to Juliet (2010)_ (qv) and _Another Happy Day (2011)_ (qv) (she also starred in the latter project). On the small screen, she appeared in an episode of _&quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009)_ (qv) and her new NBC show, _&quot;The New Normal&quot; (2012)_ (qv), got a sneak peek during the Olympics.  She lives with her two teenage children in Manhattan.</biography>

      <biography>Tall, broad shouldered character actor with Texan drawl first appeared in support in several Western vehicles both on TV and the cinema in the mid 1960s. Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen&apos;s younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel&apos;s bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker&apos;s next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _&quot;Eischied&quot; (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>III, Laurence John Fishburne</birthName>
      <biography>Critically hailed for his forceful, militant, authoritarian roles, Laurence Fishburne, who is sometimes mistaken for another tall, gap-toothed, mercurial, immensely talented African-American actor, &apos;Samuel L. Jackson&apos; (qv), came out of the black theater in New York. Born in Augusta, Georgia, on July 30, 1961, Laurence&apos;s mother, who taught high school math, transplanted her family to Brooklyn after his parents divorced. At the age of 10, he appeared in his first play, &quot;In My Many Names and Days,&quot; at a cramped little theater space in Manhattan. He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting.  In 1973, at the age of 12, Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soap _&quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1968)_ (qv) that lasted three seasons and subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themed _Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975)_ (qv). At 14 &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv) cast him in _Apocalypse Now (1979)_ (qv), which filmed for two years in the Phillippines. Laurence didn&apos;t work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles in _Rumble Fish (1983)_ (qv), _The Cotton Club (1984)_ (qv), and _Gardens of Stone (1987)_ (qv). Throughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie show _&quot;Pee-wee&apos;s Playhouse&quot; (1986)_ (qv) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time.  With the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead in &apos;John Singleton (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s urban tale _Boyz n the Hood (1991)_ (qv) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA&apos;s turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film. On stage, he would become invariably linked to playwright &apos;August Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) and his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in &quot;Two Training Running.&quot; For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as &quot;Laurence&quot; instead of &quot;Larry.&quot;  More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series &quot;Tribeca,&quot; he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-movies _The Tuskegee Airmen (1995) (TV)_ (qv) and _Miss Evers&apos; Boys (1997) (TV)_ (qv). On the larger screen, both Laurence and &apos;Angela Bassett&apos; (qv) were given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and Tina Turner in the film _What&apos;s Love Got to Do with It (1993)_ (qv). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus, &apos;Keanu Reeves&apos; (qv)&apos; mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fi _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels.  Into the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut in _Once in the Life (2000)_ (qv), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play &quot;Riff Raff,&quot; which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; as Henry II opposite &apos;Stockard Channing&apos; (qv)&apos;s Eleanor of Acquitaine.  On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player in _Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993)_ (qv); a military prisoner in _Cadence (1990)_ (qv); a college professor in Singleton&apos;s _Higher Learning (1995)_ (qv); a CIA operative in _Bad Company (1995)_ (qv); the title role in _Othello (1995)_ (qv) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horror _Event Horizon (1997)_ (qv); a Depression-era gangster in _Hoodlum (1997)_ (qv); a dogged police sergeant in &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Mystic River (2003)_ (qv); and a spelling bee coach in _Akeelah and the Bee (2006)_ (qv). Lately, he has contributed his own special brand of star power to the already-established TV hit series _&quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; (2000)_ (qv).  Earning multiple NAACP Image awards for his contribution to the entertainment business, he has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actress &apos;Hajna O. Moss&apos; (qv), who appeared with him in the films _Gardens of Stone (1987)_ (qv) and _A Rage in Harlem (1991)_ (qv). In September, 2002, Fishburne married Cuban-American actress &apos;Gina Torres (I)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <biography>A classically-trained acting veteran is David Calder. He was born August 1, 1946 in Portsmouth, England and possesses an impressive resume of accomplished work in acting since 1970. Naturally exuding wisdom and talent, David Calder often appears as just that: wise, scholarly old gentleman in almost any film or television appearance he makes. Undoubtedly an accomplished and easily-recognizable face to British audiences, however David perhaps is better known to American audiences with his appearances in high profile movies such as the James Bond spy-action film The World Is Not Enough (1999) as Sir Robert King, the on-screen father of Sophie Marceau; and then in the Mummy trilogy subtitled Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008).</biography>

      <biography>Joan Allen was born on August 20, 1956 in Rochelle, Illinois, the youngest of four children. She attended Rochelle Township High School where she was voted most likely to succeed. Joining Chicago&apos;s famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company ensemble in 1977, she was one of the group&apos;s original members and starred in a number of its original productions. Her first major film credits included two critically-lauded supporting performances that showcased her versatility: a comedic turn in the suburban murder mystery _Compromising Positions (1985)_ (qv) and a dramatic role as a blind woman befriended by a serial killer in _Manhunter (1986)_ (qv). Around the same time, Allen was making a name for herself on the New York stage; she would eventually become one of the New York theater world&apos;s most honored actresses and a winner of every major prize for her work on Broadway and off. She received a Best Actress Tony Award in 1988 for her performance, opposite &apos;John Malkovich&apos; (qv), in &apos;Lanford Wilson&apos; (qv)&apos;s Burn This and was Tony-nominated in the same category in 1989 for the title role in The Heidi Chronicles.  Continuing her work in film as well, Allen received her first Academy Award nomination for her role as Pat Nixon in &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Nixon (1995)_ (qv), for which she also won awards from seven critics&apos; associations, including the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics. Allen received her second consecutive Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role in &apos;Arthur Miller (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Crucible (1996)_ (qv). Subsequently, her work in _The Ice Storm (1997)_ (qv), opposite &apos;Kevin Kline (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sigourney Weaver&apos; (qv), and in _Pleasantville (1998)_ (qv), opposite &apos;William H. Macy&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jeff Daniels (I)&apos; (qv), earned her high praise and several critics&apos; awards; she also co-starred in the action blockbuster _Face/Off (1997)_ (qv) opposite &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Nicolas Cage&apos; (qv). For her starring role in _The Contender (2000)_ (qv), Allen received Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes, the Academy Awards, the SAG Awards, and the Independent Spirit Awards.  Throughout the early 2000s Allen worked in both film and television, with roles in three of the Bourne films - _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv), _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv), and _The Bourne Legacy (2012)_ (qv) - as well as _The Notebook (2004)_ (qv), _The Upside of Anger (2005)_ (qv), and _Death Race (2008)_ (qv). Allen also received Emmy nominations for _The Mists of Avalon (2001) (TV)_ (qv) and for the title role in the biopic _Georgia O&apos;Keeffe (2009) (TV)_ (qv), for which she was also executive producer. She was also recently seen in HBO&apos;s drama series _&quot;Luck&quot; (2011)_ (qv).  Allen married actor &apos;Peter Friedman (I)&apos; (qv) in 1990, and the two divorced in 2002; Allen&apos;s daughter Sadie was born in 1994.</biography>

      <biography>Born in London in 1980, Chris always wanted to be a part of television and film.  Chris first appeared on television as an 8-year-old on a commercial for Warburton&apos;s Bread, playing a school boy. Chris was then offered a role in Grange Hill in the late 1980s.  He then went back to filming when he was 31 years old, and appeared in over 100 productions in his first year back (during 2011-2012). He was offered roles in huge films such as Skyfall (Daniel Craig as James Bond, bumps into him), Rush (playing a German ambulance man).  It seems that Chris gets a lot of roles playing a businessman, police and CID. Chris is a regular CID officer on ITV&apos;s Midsomer Murders, and has also appeared in soaps such as Hollyoaks and Emmerdale.</biography>

      <biography>Angie Dickinson was born in Kulm, North Dakota, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Brown. Mr. Brown was the publisher of The Kulm Messenger. The family left North Dakota in 1942 when Angie was 11 years old, moving to Burbank, California. In December 1946, when she was a senior at Bellamarine Jefferson High School in Burbank, she won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights Contest. Two years later, her sister Janet did likewise. Being the daughter of a printer, Angie at first had visions of becoming a writer, but gave this up after winning her first beauty contest. After finishing college, she worked as a secretary in a Burbank airplane parts factory for 3-1/2 years. In 1953, she entered the local Miss America contest one day before the deadline and took second place. In August of the same year, she was one of five winners in a beauty contest sponsored by NBC and appeared in several television variety shows. She got her first bit part in a Warner Brothers film in 1954 and gained fame in the television series _&quot;The Millionaire&quot; (1955)_ (qv) and got her first good film role opposite &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dean Martin (I)&apos; (qv) in _Rio Bravo (1959)_ (qv). Her success then spiraled until she became one of the nation&apos;s top movie stars.</biography>

      <biography>An actor on television since the early 1990s, Michael Harney frequently essayed tough men with deeply complicated interior lives in such acclaimed series as &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (ABC 1993-2005), &quot;Deadwood&quot; (HBO 2005-2006) and &quot;Weeds&quot; (Showtime 2005-2012). Harney&apos;s ability to tap into the emotional and spiritual elements of his characters was the result of substantial training and work on the New York theater scene, as well as his early career path as a social worker and prison reform advocate. After years of anonymity on the Off-Broadway circuit, Harney earned his big break as a morally compromised police officer on &quot;Blue,&quot; which led to steady work as a guest performer on countless series. In 2005, he played a hateful townsperson on &quot;Deadwood,&quot; which further increased his profile; he successful transitioned from recurring turns on various series, including an alcoholic detective on &quot;Weeds,&quot; to his first turn as a series regular on &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; (2013).</biography>

      <biography>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation, Jeffrey Wright&apos;s undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business. Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990&apos;s Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright&apos;s harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright&apos;s skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>25 April 1940</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Pacino, Alfredo James</birthName>
      <biography>One of the greatest actors in all of film history, Al Pacino established himself during one of film&apos;s greatest decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies. Born on April 25, 1940, in the Bronx, New York, Pacino&apos;s parents (Salvatore and Rose) divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents&apos; house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to make it to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach &apos;Lee Strasberg&apos; (qv), creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many &apos;70s-era actors. After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, he finally hit it big with &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot;, winning an Obie award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for &quot;Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot;. His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a junkie in _The Panic in Needle Park (1971)_ (qv) after his film debut in _Me, Natalie (1969)_ (qv). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv) was one of the most sought-after of the time: &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Warren Beatty (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Ryan O&apos;Neal (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv) and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv) had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--didn&apos;t want him. Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola&apos;s) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone&apos;s career, including Pacino&apos;s, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, however, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama _Serpico (1973)_ (qv) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film _Dog Day Afternoon (1975)_ (qv). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the &quot;Best Actor&quot; Academy Award. He faltered slightly with _Bobby Deerfield (1977)_ (qv), but regained his stride with _...And Justice for All. (1979)_ (qv), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. This would, unfortunately, signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as _Cruising (1980)_ (qv) and _Author! Author! (1982)_ (qv). He took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult hit _Scarface (1983)_ (qv), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. _Revolution (1985)_ (qv) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, _The Local Stigmatic (1990)_ (qv), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv) as a hard-drinking cop. It marked the second phase of Pacino&apos;s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice. Returning to the Corleones, he made _The Godfather: Part III (1990)_ (qv) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful _Dick Tracy (1990)_ (qv). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for _Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)_ (qv). He went into romantic mode for _Frankie and Johnny (1991)_ (qv). In 1992 he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in _Scent of a Woman (1992)_ (qv). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. _Carlito&apos;s Way (1993)_ (qv) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama _Heat (1995)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv) and co-starring &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv), although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director&apos;s chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation _Looking for Richard (1996)_ (qv). _City Hall (1996)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv) and _The Devil&apos;s Advocate (1997)_ (qv) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv), he gave two commanding performances in _The Insider (1999)_ (qv) and _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood&apos;s most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new set of twins with longtime girlfriend &apos;Beverly D&apos;Angelo (I)&apos; (qv). His romantic history includes a long-time romance with &quot;Godfather&quot; co-star &apos;Diane Keaton&apos; (qv). With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies&apos; true legends.</biography>

      <biography>Born in Munich in 1969, Gedeon was raised bilingual (English &amp; German). He was sent to boarding school in England at the age of 8 and transferred to American high school at the age of 12. Gedeon starred in his first movie (Aunt Maria) when he was 10, his second lead role followed one year later in the American / German co-production Blood and Honor (3 part mini series) as Hartmut Keller. By demand of the American and German Producers each scene was shot once in English and once in German, due to his bilingual upbringing, Gedeon was the only actor who did not have to be dubbed in either version.  Gedeon continuously worked in various projects during school vacations until he dropped out of high school after 11th grade. At this time he concentrated on training for 2 years, attending musical school and taking speech and acting classes on the side.  In 1988 Gedeon starred, next to Tony Curtis and Birol Head On by Fathi Akin), in the motion Picture Welcome to Germany which marked the beginning of his career as a grownup. Since then Gedeon has acted in numerous films, including Acting it Out (German film award/ Movie and Bavarian Film award/Actor) by acclaimed German director Wortman, Silence like Glass by Carl Schenkel and Making Up (Student Academy Award USA/German Film Award) by Katja von Garnier. He also starred in the internationally successful television series Detectiv Rex (sold to over 140 territories) and Kobra 11 (Action series, sold to over 120 territories).  in 2006 Gedeon portrayed Henry Neumann, a Jewish boxer trapped in a boxcar with his family on the way to Auschwitz, in the motion picture The last Train. This challenging part, it seems, was the perfect preparation for the biggest opportunity in his career to date, the part of the Jewish Basterd (Will Wicky) in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s new movie Inglorious Basterds.</biography>

      <biography>Elizabeth Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, a small city in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts near the New York border, on February 10, 1974. She describes herself as having been seen as a &quot;goody two-shoes&quot; in her youth who was nominated for the local Harvest Queen.  Banks left home to attend college at the University of Pennsylvania--from which she graduated Magna cum Laude--and went on to attend the Advanced Training Program at the prestigious American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, from which she graduated in 1996. She then moved to New York and worked in the theater, and began getting small roles in films and on television. Seeking more screen work, she moved to Los Angeles and soon began snagging supporting roles. She also had to change her name, to avoid confusion with actress &apos;Elizabeth Mitchell (I)&apos; (qv), and thus changed her last name to Banks.  Her first breakthrough role was as Betty Brant, the secretary of the cantankerous newspaper tycoon in &apos;Sam Raimi&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Spider-Man (2002)_ (qv). She followed up this performance with small roles in other movies: _Swept Away (2002)_ (qv), &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv), _Seabiscuit (2003)_ (qv) and _The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)_ (qv). In 2003 she won the Exciting New Face Award at the Young Hollywood Awards.  Although the winsome, beautiful Banks projected an exceptionally charming screen presence that drew comparisons to &apos;Audrey Hepburn (I)&apos; (qv), she primarily remained in supporting roles. Audiences began to take notice when Banks took the lead in such films as &apos;Kevin Smith (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008)_ (qv) and as &apos;Laura Bush (I)&apos; (qv) in &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s biopic of &apos;George W. Bush&apos; (qv), _W. (2008/I)_ (qv).  In television Banks was a recurring guest star on _&quot;Scrubs&quot; (2001)_ (qv) as Dr. Kim Briggs, the love interest of &apos;Zach Braff&apos; (qv)&apos;s J.D. In 2010 she was cast as &apos;Alec Baldwin&apos; (qv)&apos;s love interest in season four of _&quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006)_ (qv). Originally her character was only scheduled to appear in four episodes, but she was brought back as a recurring character for two more seasons, and earned Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for two consecutive years.  Now in the spotlight, Banks appeared in back-to-back films, co-starring in _Our Idiot Brother (2011)_ (qv), _Man on a Ledge (2012)_ (qv), _What to Expect When You&apos;re Expecting (2012)_ (qv) and _People Like Us (2012)_ (qv). She also won the highly coveted role as Effie Trinket in _The Hunger Games (2012)_ (qv). She also stars in such films as _Pitch Perfect (2012)_ (qv), _Frank or Francis (????)_ (qv), and _The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)_ (qv).  Banks married &apos;Max Handelman&apos; (qv), a sports writer and producer, in 2003. They welcomed a son, Felix Handleman, who was born via a surrogate in March 2011.</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Gregory Stenson grew up on the mean streets of Las Vegas, Nevada. Today we know him as the 6 foot box-office hero, but his growth spurt didn&apos;t occur to late in his teen years, thus his small size made him a target for bullies. The brutalities he endured as a youngster only made him stronger however and has helped to make him the person he is today. Greg has two loving parents and did the best they could with their lower class status. Gregory hated that his family didn&apos;t have all the things they would like to, things they saw while watching programs like The Jefferson&apos;s and Goodtimes. He wished his family could have such luxuries and live like these TV families did. His major goal in life became to do the best he could to make his families life the best it could possibly be!  His grades in school were never the best, and Gregory couldn&apos;t see himself as a suit anyway, so Gregory looked to other avenues to achieve his goal. It was about this time that his body caught up with and surpassed the size of his classmates, and it wasn&apos;t long before the coach of his High School Football Team noticed Gregory on campus. Greg took to Football like a fish to water and excelled greatly, his skills as a Line Backer helped drive his team to two State Championship wins. By his senior year Greg was a hot commodity and had scouts from colleges all over the country looking him over. Greg took his time deciding on who he should go with and finally decided on Antelope Valley College in beautiful Lancaster, California and the outstanding Marauders Football Team. While an odd choice it was nonetheless the one that Gregory made. His reasoning better to be a big fish in a small pond than a big fish in a much larger pond! His talents as a Line Backer once again proved strong here as they did in High School. He brought many victories to his team the Marauders through his tenure with them and was on the Fast Track to an NFL Career when tragedy struck in one the most prolific games of his college career. During the third down as the Quarter Back was looking for a clear Receiver and a shot to bring the team to victory, Gregory was holding the line with all he had. He had already held off to heavy blitzes on his QB but the last push was too much and he was overrun by two Rushers and was left lying on the ground after the play was through. Gregory didn&apos;t get up and his teammates ran to his side, where they found him screaming in agony.  Gregory was rushed to the local hospital where it was found that his Bicep muscle was entirely ripped from his bone. A terrible injury to have and one that took many months of reconstructive surgery and therapy to correct. Unfortunately this spelled the end of Gregory&apos;s football career as the doctor told him one more injury like this and they don&apos;t know what would happen!  Greg became disillusioned with life and fell into a very dark period in his life, (little is known about this part of his life?) but re-emerged a year later with new determination and with his original goal of a better life for himself and his family at the forefront once more. Gregory had endless nights without sleep trying to figure out how he could make his dream come true, then it hit him like a blitz from a forward in his football days. While thinking about the TV shows he loved so much as a kid, he thought he could play those parts as good if not better than say J.J. did on Goodtimes. So with a new resolve he decided to be an actor.  Just as Gregory had chosen an obscure approach to his Football College Career, he again chose the same method on his way to his Hollywood Movie Actor Career. Gregory didn&apos;t head to Los Angeles or New York as most people do, instead he went to back to Sin City itself, Las Vegas. He knew that more and more movies were being shot there and decided that a big fish in a smaller pond was good enough for him this time as well. He signed with many different agencies as soon as he arrived back in Vegas and not surprisingly was given a very warm reception. His good looks and boyish charm did very well for Gregory indeed. As his agents looked for work for him, sometimes staying up very late to make sure Gregory was looked at seriously for some of the bigger roles, Gregory knew he couldn&apos;t just wait for that &quot;right&quot; acting role to come along so he branched off to &quot;character acting.&quot;  His agents found him work at The Aladdin Casino playing a Genie. Greg enjoyed this work immensely, he loved it when the tourists would smile at him and ask for a photo with him, he thought to himself, &quot;Well if this is what its like to be a big-time movie actor, I think I&apos;m gonna love it.&quot; While playing the Genie he continually went out on auditions, sometimes he would miss some of his work playing Genie, but his producers understood his need to move his career along and gave him time off as needed. While he had not won any parts on the screen or TV yet, he continually tried, knocking down many barriers as he tried. After a year of playing Genie he thought he had explored all the realms of the character so he decided he needed something fresh as it wasn&apos;t fair to him or &quot;Genie&quot; to keep playing a character he saw as &quot;evolved&quot;. So without another job to go to he bid the Aladdin farewell.  But it wasn&apos;t long before Caesar&apos;s Palace heard Gregory was available and immediately made an offer to him to play &quot;Marc Anthony&quot; at their casino. Gregory couldn&apos;t believe his luck, the role of Marc Anthony was one of the most sought-after roles in Vegas. Here he was being offered the role without even an audition! Gregory loved his new role and explored all facets of the character in his day to day workings.  Greg&apos;s movie career also got a shot in the arm at this time as well. One of his agents found him a very small role in the comedy hit &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;. Greg played of all things a security guard in this picture, having never had any experience as a security guard in real life, he learned all he could about his role, going as far as doing temp work as one, before filming started to get an idea of what the character should be about. When the time came to shoot Gregory was more than ready, and brought to the part more that even the writer had hoped to see. Gregory was on his way!  While he continued his Marc Anthony role he went for more and more auditions, picking up a commercial or music video starring role along the way. Gregory&apos;s biggest break came when &quot;Bubble Boy&quot; was released and one of the producers assistants of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv), &apos;Harvey Weintrapper&apos; saw Gregory and his performance. In the script of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) there was a part for a white security officer, and this part was very critical to the unfolding of the whole plot of the movie. Weintrapper called Gregory in and gave him a shot at the part, Gregory with all his zeal again researched the part prior to the meeting. To understand the role he shadowed one of Caesar&apos;s Hotel security men for a day to see what it was all about. When Gregory read the part, Weintrapper was blown away, he had expected a great read from Gregory but this was beyond all expectations. Even though Gregory differed from the original characters concept, they decided to take a chance.  _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) became a stunning hit spectacular and owed this in no small way to Gregory Stenson&apos;s portrayal of The Sentry in his stunning scene that featured him along with two actors each from a Dynasty of acting Royalty. Gregory&apos;s role paired him up against the dynamic Scott Caan (James Caan&apos;s Son) and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck&apos;s Brother and best buddy as well of Matt Damon). Both Scott and Casey were most impressed with Gregory&apos;s work and invited him to hang out with them after the shoot thus beginning a friendship that lasts to this day. It is a little known secret around insider circles that the three of them are looking at a &quot;western&quot; script to do together.</biography>

      <biography>Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a &quot;show trial&quot; in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called &quot;Goldeneye,&quot; took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called &quot;Casino Royale.&quot; Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56.</biography>

      <biography>Known throughout the music industry as the &quot;king of jungle&quot;, Goldie is an artist whose ferocious creativity knows no bounds. Born and bred on the breakdancing and hip-hop culture he absorbed during trips to the States in his youth, Goldie was a graffitti artist and an album cover artist before receiving the backing to record his first track, &quot;Terminator&quot;, in 1993. His debut album, &quot;Timeless&quot;, followed two years later, and was hailed by critics as a masterpiece. The album fused the hypersyncopated breakbeats and reggae chic common in jungle music with a provocative bassline and soulful diva vocals. That album&apos;s title track, a 21-minute symphonic piece, was a masterstroke, and the lively &quot;Inner City Life&quot; was a smash. With his reputation firmly established, he released his sophomore album in 1998, Saturnzreturn. The album&apos;s opening track, &quot;Mother&quot; a 60-minute orchestral/drum-n-bass piece, is a haunting track and serves as the companion piece to &quot;Timeless.&quot; The remainder of the album, featuring cameos by &apos;David Bowie&apos; (qv), &apos;Noel Gallagher (II)&apos; (qv) of &apos;Oasis (I)&apos; (qv), and rapper &apos;KRS-One&apos; (qv), is a mishmash of Goldie&apos;s signature sound. Critics were not impressed with this follow-up effort, however; many lambasted the album as too &quot;self-indulgent&quot;. Nonetheless, no one can deny that Goldie is an artist who will continue to amaze his fans and the industry with his epic scope and syncopated vision.</biography>

      <biography>Since its beginning in 1880, the University of Southern California Trojan Marching Band has become the largest spirit organization on campus. The Spirit of Troy consists of 275 student musicians and auxiliaries representing 60 fields of undergraduate and graduate degrees. The band received its first exposure to the national limelight when it had the distinct privilege of performing under the baton of John Phillip Sousa. The band&apos;s real break came when it formed the 10th Olympic Braid for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Once was not enough, so, in 1984, 125 Trojans made up the core of a mass band performing at the opening and closing ceremonies of the 23rd Olympiad in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The contemporary Trojan Band has been under the direction of &apos;Arthur C. Bartner&apos; (qv) since 1970. A graduate of the University of Michigan, Dr. Bartner developed both the &quot;drive-it&quot; style of marching that has become legendary and the &quot;rock-chart&quot; sound copied by collegiate programs across the country.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>15 March 1970</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Curtis Rivers was born in Guisborough, North Yorkshire, England in 1970.  He vividly recalls his ambition to become a professional movie stuntman, which began at the age of 8, when he started to send letters to numerous TV stations in order to find out how to achieve this goal.  He was told that he would have to become a professional actor, and highly skilled in no fewer than 6 different disciplines, such as Judo, Fencing, Horse Riding, SCUBA Diving and Parachuting.  Unfazed, he was acting by the age of 12, running half-marathons at 14, SCUBA diving at 15 and skydiving by 16.  On leaving school, Curtis began organising various expeditions and adventures, while adding new skills to his stunt training. Adventures led him as far as the Transylvanian Alps, The Black Sea and beyond.  In his early twenties, he became a professional actor, stage work including a national tour of the U.K. and Ireland, and TV work including the role of Detective Constable Galley in the popular TV Series &quot;The Chief&quot;.  In 1996, at the age of 25, he finally fulfilled his life-long ambition of joining the elite ranks of The British Stunt Register, skilled to the highest levels in Judo, Jujitsu, Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Sport Parachuting, Fencing, Riding, High Diving, SCUBA Diving, Hang-Gliding, Trampolining, and Power Boating.  Within just a few short weeks, Rivers found himself doubling for stars such as Hollywood actor Patrick Bergen (Sleeping With The Enemy with Julia Roberts).  In the years that followed, Curtis worked on numerous movies and television shows, including the Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, which saw him killed by Bond no fewer than 5 times! In the 2002 swashbuckling epic &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Rivers did all of the fencing, riding and even underwater stunts for the star, Hollywood actor James Caviezal (Mel Gibson&apos;s &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; and &quot;Frequency&quot;).  Rivers has also been a regular stunt performer on popular British TV shows such as Casualty, Holby, The Bill, Emmerdale, Ashes to Ashes, Spooks, Doctor Who, Torchwood, Whitechapel, and Midsomer Murders, whilst working on various overseas TV projects.  By 2000, Rivers began to seek new avenues for his talents, and added promotional and P.R. work to his growing list of skills. He promoted the launch of Extreme Magazine in 2000, by coordinating the cover shoot - which saw him reading the magazine 20 metres beneath the Caribbean Ocean, in shark-infested waters! He also wrote a feature for the magazine.  This led to a number of similar magazine promotions, such as Dubai&apos;s SMART magazine (which saw him reading the magazine whilst hanging from a crane - 200ft above the ground!) and also led to him writing various featured articles, for numerous magazines and newspapers all over the world.  By 2001, his successful marketing and P.R. campaigns led to the funding of his first Guinness World Record.  Never opting for the easy life, Rivers chose a world record that had remained intact for over 45 years, despite numerous attempts to better it. The record he chose to attempt was The Longest Duration Parachute Jump.  This project saw him training in industrial freezers as the air temperature at jump altitude would be 60 degrees below freezing. It also required high altitude chamber training with the SAS, and numerous test jumps on oxygen from high altitude.  On 14 February 2002, Rivers took off from Pozoblanco, Spain, and flew in a hot-air balloon to 25,000ft above the earth. He jumped from the balloon and activated his parachute immediately. With skillful canopy control, he over-flew the Andalucian Mountains and flew into the Guinness Book of Records with a flight time of 45 minutes.  This bettered the long-standing official record by 5 whole minutes.  Enjoying the widespread publicity, his sponsors Damart Thermals agreed to fund his next world record attempt. This time he set his sights firmly on the Highest Bungee Jump.  The official Guinness World Record was 8,500ft. However, an unofficial claim came to the attention of Rivers and his team, a claim of a bungee jump from a balloon flying 10,500ft high!  Curtis therefore set his sights higher still, on a jump from the limits of where a human can breathe without oxygen after taking off from sea level - 15,000ft.  On 5 May 2002, Rivers bungee jumped from a hot-air balloon flying 15,200ft above Puertolano in Spain, and was awarded his second Guinness World Record.  Footage of the jump went global, earning his sponsor over £470,000 worth of publicity in the U.K. alone, and over £1million of worldwide publicity and brand promotion.  Rivers still works in the TV &amp; Film business, now also in demand for his skills as both Stunt Coordinator and 2nd Unit (Action) Director.</biography>

      <birthName>Crowe, Russell Ira</birthName>
      <biography>Born in New Zealand, Russell has made his home in Australia since he was a small child. The son of movie set caterers, Russell got the acting bug early in life. Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell&apos;s first big break came with two films ... the first, _Romper Stomper (1992)_ (qv), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, _The Sum of Us (1994)_ (qv), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. &apos;Sharon Stone (I)&apos; (qv) heard of him from _Romper Stomper (1992)_ (qv) and wanted him for her film, _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv). But filming on _The Sum of Us (1994)_ (qv) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. _Virtuosity (1995)_ (qv), starring &apos;Denzel Washington&apos; (qv), put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. _Virtuosity (1995)_ (qv), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers. _L.A. Confidential (1997)_ (qv), Russell&apos;s third American film, brought him the US fame and attention that his fans have felt he deserved all along. Missing the Oscar nod this time around, he didn&apos;t seem deterred and signed to do his first film with The &apos;Walt Disney&apos; (qv) Company, _Mystery, Alaska (1999)_ (qv). He has recently achieved even more success and awards for his performances in _Gladiator (2000)_ (qv) and _A Beautiful Mind (2001)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Ronald Eaton Giles was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, on November 13, 1947. The Son of blue collar parents Henry and Dolores (Arguello) Giles, he was the third of five children with an ethnic heritage of English-Irish, Native American, Mexican and Eastern European. Ronnie was raised in Lodi, NJ, from where he graduated High School in 1965.  He joined the US Army in October of 1965 and served in Vietnam (April 1966 to April 1967) as an Infantryman, Armored Personnel Carrier Driver, Ammo/Radio Man &amp; Tunnel Rat with &quot;A&quot; Troop, 3/4 Cavalry, 25th Infantry Division, Cu Chi RVN. Upon discharge from the Army in 1968, Ronnie decided to pursue his life-long dream of becoming an actor.  He studied with &apos;William Hickey (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Alice Spivak&apos; (qv) and &apos;Kathryn Sergava&apos; (qv) at the famed &apos;Herbert Berghof&apos; (qv) Studio in New York City, from 1968 to 1969. After working at a series of jobs, raising a family and pursuing his Acting career all at the same time over a 20-year period, he temporarily &quot;retired&quot; from Acting in 1988.  During that same year, Ronnie rejoined the military full-time, alternately serving with the New Jersey and Idaho Army National Guard. In 1996, he transferred to the full-time Army Reserve based out of Staten Island, New York. For the next ten years, he worked in a wide variety of assignments, including Human Resources Administration, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Transportation, Waste, Fraud and Abuse and Equal Opportunity.  Post 9-11, he simultaneously worked in assignments with local, state and federal Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence Agencies. During his last two years of service, Ronnie was attached to the Defense Intelligence Agency in Washington, DC, and attained the Rank of Sergeant First Class/E-7. After an Army career that spanned over four decades, he retired from the military, having reached his mandatory retirement age of 60 on November 13, 2007.  He has two grown children and a Grandson, and is now back to pursuing his acting and singing careers full-time. In his spare time, Ronnie works as a volunteer Tour Guide at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Holmdell, NJ, and is in a wonderful relationship with his childhood sweetheart, Caroline. To keep himself &quot;grounded-in-reality,&quot; he still hangs-out with many of the same friends he&apos;s had since his childhood.  He is a life-member of the 25th Inf. Div. Association, 3/4 Cavalry Association, VFW, Disabled American Veterans, the Vietnam Veterans of America (Little Ferry, NJ, Chapter 800), SAG-AFTRA and Actors Equity Association. His hero is his Father Henry Eaton Giles, whose name appears on the wall of The Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC.</biography>

      <biography>Nikki was born Sept 2nd, 1997 in Rochelle, Illinois, a town of what is now about 10,000. Rochelle and surrounding communities have also been home to some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest celebrities (Joan Allen and Cindy Crawford to name a couple) and several movies have been filmed on location there. Nikki found her way into acting when she was just four years old. A photographer that had shot some yearly photos of Nikki liked the results from the shoot and proceeded to show some talent agents in the area. Soon Nikki was lucky enough to acquire representation in Chicago and in LA. Coincidentally at the same time she was cast as Raven, an adorable little vampire in the award-winning short Teenage Bikini Vampire and was also cast in her first feature film The Rockville Slayer. During this time she was also contacted by Mali Finn, one of Hollywood&apos;s top casting directors to audition for the role of Jennifer Connelly&apos;s daughter in Dark Water. Nikki eventually lost the role to actress Ariel Gade but with her path already set and seemingly being led by fate, decided to immerse herself full force into the world of entertainment. Her willingness to work hard, mannerism and dedication has helped her greatly in her achievements. Nikki loves all aspects of the film industry and isn&apos;t afraid to jump in and help out whenever she can.  Nikki also loves to write! With the support of many she was fortunate enough to bring one of her own stories to life. She also stars in, co-directed and produced the project (more details to come soon). Nikki has appeared at award ceremonies and conventions. One of her fondest memories came when she was invited to co-host The Dragon Con Independent Film Awards with long time actor Dean Stockwell. She has also been featured several times in Fangoria, one of America&apos;s top Horror magazines and is a current Member of The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror and The Burbank Tournament of Roses Association. Nikki is also an avid supporter of children&apos;s charities and is also the co-founder of Buggaboo Books, a non-profit organization that puts books into school libraries. Nikki has an extensive list of credits that include print, voice over, music videos,commercials and films. Some of her print work consists of SC Johnson,Scott Foresman, Gap, Tapco, AJ Prindle and RC Toys. She has also done commercials for Chevrolet and several music videos. One of Nikki&apos;s most current and favorite voice over projects is The New Testament Youth Edition Audio Bible starring some of Hollywood&apos;s hottest young Celebes like Corbin Bleu, Anna Sophia Robb, Emily Osment,Sean Astin and Marshall Allman.  Thus far Nikki has worked on well over a dozen feature films. Past projects include POTC-Dead Mans Chest, Dork of the Rings, Crazy love, Broke Sky, The Promotion, Dog Jack and Rob Zombies Halloween. Some current projects are Leading Ladies, Fallen Souls, The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas, the highly anticipated Johnny Violence and Satanic Panic(also produced by Nikki) due out later this year. Nikki also has her own production company and is working on several new project including a pilot made for television. Nikki has been blessed with the opportunity to travel and to work alongside some of the most passionate and dedicated people in the industry such as Gore Verbinski, Nic Cage,Jerry Bruckheimer, Jeff Burr, Matt Damon, Steven Soderbergh , Steve Conrad, Orlando Bloom, Sean William Scott, Reiko Aylesworth, Keira Knightley and many more. She looks forward to meeting many new people and to welcoming with much anticipation all the opportunities that lie ahead.</biography>

      <biography>Sean Bean, England&apos;s most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful, green-eyed blonde&apos;s roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villians, as in &quot;Clarissa,&quot; passionate lovers like Mellors in &quot;Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover,&quot; rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in &quot;Troy,&quot; where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.  Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Macbeth,&quot; where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed.  Bean, however, remains himself, a man&apos;s man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK, and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, &quot;I don&apos;t have any problems with women seeing me as their ideal bit of &apos;rough&apos;. Why would I?&quot; Well, good to know, because his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.</biography>

      <birthName>Meloni, Christopher Peter</birthName>
      <biography>Blessed with a piercing, blue-eyed glint, brawny looks, cocky &quot;tough guy&quot; stance and effortless charisma, TV&apos;s Christopher Meloni also drew on his sexy Italian heritage to grab audiences attention, male and female alike, finding breakthrough small screen stardom playing both sides of the law.  Audiences first were taken in by his sexually arresting portrayal of a sociopathic killer in the gripping prison drama _&quot;Oz&quot; (1997)_ (qv) on cable TV. Although his small screen roots were in 90s situation comedy, the network powers-that-be wisely discovered his power and allure as a dramatic star and quickly handed him his own prime-time crime series, _&quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999)_ (qv), as a not-quite-by-the-book crime detective. This one-two punch of &quot;Oz&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; put Meloni, who seems to grow sexier with age, on the map and well on top, where he remains today.  Christopher Peter Meloni was born on April 2, 1961, in Washington, D.C., the son of Robert, an endocrinologist, and Cecile Meloni. Of Italian and French-Canadian parentage, he attended St. Stephen&apos;s School and played quarterback for his high school team. Developing an interest in acting rather early in life, he attended the University of Colorado at Boulder following high school graduation. He initially majored in acting but wound up earning a degree in history in 1983. Acting won out in the long run, however, and Chris relocated to New York where he studied with acting guru &apos;Sanford Meisner&apos; (qv) at the renowned Neighborhood Playhouse.  Supplementing his income during these lean years by taking advantage of his powerful physique (as construction worker, bouncer, personal trainer), Meloni worked his way up the acting ladder via parts in commercials. With a full head of hair in the early days, he broke into series TV in 1989, the first being the already-established cable football comedy _&quot;1st &amp; Ten&quot; (1984)_ (qv). In this sitcom, which was HBO&apos;s very first back in 1984, Chris played ex-con quarterback Vito Del Greco (aka &quot;Johnny Gunn&quot;). The series&apos; star &apos;Delta Burke&apos; (qv) had already left the cast by the time Chris came aboard in its final season.  A second sitcom arrived almost immediately with the stereotypical Italian family sitcom _&quot;The Fanelli Boys&quot; (1990)_ (qv) featuring Chris as dim-eyed, skirt-chasing Frankie Fanelli, one of the four &quot;dees, dem and dos&quot; sons of Brooklynite widow Theresa Fanelli (&apos;Ann Morgan Guilbert&apos; (qv)). Despite a strong, boisterous cast, the show was painfully obvious and met an early demise. True to nature, Chris gave voice and added to the fun as a cocky, mooching high school teen who knows the &quot;how to&apos;s&quot; of attracting pretty girl dinos in the animated prehistoric series _&quot;Dinosaurs&quot; (1991)_ (qv). He also made a manly mark in mini-movies with co-starring roles in such &quot;women&quot; dramas as _In a Child&apos;s Name (1991) (TV)_ (qv) starring &apos;Valerie Bertinelli&apos; (qv), _Something to Live for: The Alison Gertz Story (1992) (TV)_ (qv), which top-lined &apos;Molly Ringwald&apos; (qv), _Without a Kiss Goodbye (1993) (TV)_ (qv) as the caring husband of &apos;Lisa Hartman (I)&apos; (qv), and the &apos;Connie Sellecca&apos; (qv) starrer _A Dangerous Affair (1995) (TV)_ (qv).  An interchangeable ability to convey both heartfelt sympathy and virile menace did not go by unnoticed. After minor parts on the big screen with _Clean Slate (1994)_ (qv), _Junior (1994)_ (qv) and _Twelve Monkeys (1995)_ (qv), Chris drew strong notices in the featured role of gangster Johnnie Marzzone in the classic neo-noir _Bound (1996)_ (qv), which earned cult status for its sexually-charged lesbian sub-storyline. A tough recurring part on &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, a typical mafia role in the mini-series _&quot;The Last Don&quot; (1997)_ (qv) and another short-lived comedic series lead (_&quot;Leaving L.A.&quot; (1997)_ (qv)) finally led to a big payoff in the brutal and brilliant cable series _&quot;Oz&quot; (1997)_ (qv).  Christopher&apos;s introduction to the Oz prison as bisexual psychopath Chris Keller was powerhouse casting and he drew immediate notice and critical applause into the show&apos;s second season. Unflinching in its blood-soaked presentation of life behind bars, Chris&apos; raw animal magnetism was unparalleled on the show and his steamy, erotic couplings with another male prisoner on screen promoted him swiftly to gay icon status. Undaunted by the possible career-damaging effects that could occur, Chris&apos; frank acceptance and acknowledgment was admirable indeed and his outright support of human rights causes earned him high marks. The father of two (daughter Sophia Eva Pietra (born March 23, 2001), and son Dante Amadeo (born January 2, 2004), he has been married since 1995 to production designer &apos;Sherman Williams&apos; (_The Dark Backward (1991)_ (qv)).  Chris&apos; sudden burst of cable notoriety earned him his own prime time NBC series. With the veteran &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; program developing a sister spin-off, _&quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999)_ (qv), Meloni raised the bar with his trenchant pairing with co-star &apos;Mariska Hargitay&apos; (qv) as partners of a special victims crime unit. Despite the show&apos;s reality-driven approach, Meloni and Hargitay&apos;s dynamite chemistry carried the show to a new level. Allowing their characters&apos; more serious flaws to surface, Meloni, in particular, managed to convey Detective Stabler&apos;s private pain and personal turmoil with a raw poignancy. Both he and Hargitay have been honored with Emmy award nominations for their work here (she has won).  Occasionally appearing on stage, Chris&apos; theater credits include &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (as Starbuck) (1998) and &quot;Comers&quot; (1998), both at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. He earned standout reviews as Eddie Carbone in &apos;Arthur Miller (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;A View from the Bridge,&quot; which he performed at Dublin&apos;s Gate Theatre in 2005. In 2006 he joined the campy proceedings at an Actors&apos; Fund of America Benefit of the soap opera spoof &quot;Die, Mommie Die!&quot; starring drag illusionist and &quot;Oz&quot; alumnus &apos;Charles Busch (I)&apos; (qv).  Going well over a decade&apos;s worth of service to the series that made him a household name, Meloni finally retired his TV detective in 2011. Throughout the show&apos;s run he continued to flaunt his humorous side, showing up on such parody shows as &quot;Mad TV&quot; and cracking up on the various night time TV haunts. On film he continues to shatter his dramatic image in such fare as _The Souler Opposite (1998)_ (qv), _Wet Hot American Summer (2001)_ (qv), _Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004)_ (qv) and its sequel _Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008)_ (qv).  While he has not found outright stardom on the big screen (he has nominally played &quot;other man&quot; roles in such popular films as _Runaway Bride (1999)_ (qv) and _Nights in Rodanthe (2008)_ (qv)), Chris has more than proved his staying power since he left the popular series. More recently he moved forward as a writer/producer/director/star of the comedy film _Dirty Movie (2011)_ (qv), which also has in its cast &quot;L&amp;O: SVU&quot; co-star &apos;Diane Neal&apos; (qv). In addition, Chris supplied the voice of DC Comics classic character Hal Jordan (aka Green Lantern) in the animated movie _Green Lantern: First Flight (2009) (V)_ (qv). He also has held regular roles on the series _&quot;True Blood&quot; (2008)_ (qv) in 2012 and _&quot;Surviving Jack&quot; (2014)_ (qv) as well as strong cinematic parts in the Superman film _Man of Steel (2013)_ (qv) and in _Small Time (2014)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Henry Silva was born on September 15, 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged &apos;Michael V. Gazzo&apos; (qv)&apos;s play &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students &apos;Ben Gazzara (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Shelley Winters&apos; (qv), &apos;Harry Guardino&apos; (qv), &apos;Anthony Franciosa (I)&apos; (qv) and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including _The Bravados (1958)_ (qv), _Green Mansions (1959)_ (qv), _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (1960)_ (qv), _The Manchurian Candidate (1962)_ (qv) and _Johnny Cool (1963)_ (qv).  An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva&apos;s turning-point picture was a spaghetti western, _Un fiume di dollari (1966)_ (qv), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted &apos;Charles Bronson (I)&apos; (qv) to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv) in the film _Contract on Cherry Street (1977) (TV)_ (qv), then signed on as Buck Rogers&apos; evil adversary Kane in _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) (TV)_ (qv) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe&apos;s production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day &quot;to keep in shape and relieve tension&quot;.</biography>

      <biography>With a natural aptitude for business administration and the creative arts, Kelly was already making some pretty decent money on weekends at age 10, with lemonade stands, garage sales, car washes and baby-sitting. By age 14, she was taking university-level graphic arts courses, and teaching arts &amp; crafts to kids, age 5-12.  While still in high school, Kelly worked part-time as a salon assistant, doing hair colouring touch-ups, mani-pedis, facials, hair styling and make-up application for weddings and fashion shows. She also worked part-time on weekends for a real estate agent, prepping for open houses by cleaning and staging the properties for viewing by prospective buyers, then served sandwiches, coffee and tea while the agent worked the room during the open house.  After high school, Kelly decided to further her education by taking part-time college courses in graphic arts, photography and psychology, while working part-time in the evenings at a movie theatre and several retail stores. After completing her college courses, she was hired to co-manage an upscale night club, with duties that included advertising, public relations and booking musical talent for the nocturnal hotspot. This soon lead to a brief gig as lead vocalist in a pop/rock band. Utilizing her ability to mimic the vocal style of numerous recording artists including Olivia Newton John, Karen Carpenter, Pat Benatar, Debbie Harry, Annie Lennox, Madonna, Paula Abdul and Sade, among others, Kelly was able to transfer those talents to broadcasting in her early 20s, singing jingles and creating a variety of character voices for radio and television. This eventually lead to a two-year stint as an on-air personality for a radio station in upstate New York where she wrote news, sports and entertainment stories for live broadcast, and ad spots for local businesses. By age 27, Kelly had become a sought-after freelance public relations consultant, journalist, graphic artist and photographer.  Not content to rest on her laurels, Kelly launched yet another career at age 30, working as a freelance personal assistant, with a wide range of services for busy professionals such as office cleaning/organizing, reception and administration, property management, catering and event-planning, house/pet-sitting, image/wardrobe consulting, shopping and errands, writing, graphic arts and photography services, haircuts, manicures, facials and aroma-therapeutic massage. Soon, her client list boasted everyone from retail clerks, bus drivers and construction workers to lawyers, architects, accountants, security consultants, structural engineers and real estate developers.  At age 32, Kelly launched Artistic Interiors. As an artist and interior decorator, she created unique sculptures, wall art, simple furniture and accessories for clients who had a taste for the bizarre and unusual, and designed spaces with a historic or theatrical theme (e.g. decorating them to look like an African hut, a Tibetan monastery, a Persian harem, an Egyptian tomb, gothic castle, ancient cave or spaceship). Her flair for the dramatic eventually led to a side-career as a set designer/decorator and prop-maker for local theatre and TV shows.  Having dabbled in the entertainment industry since high school, Kelly&apos;s interest in film and television production began to take precedence after she scored a sweet gig as a copywriter, floor director and production assistant for CHUM (now Bell Media) and Rogers Television in 2002, followed by a handful of voice-over and acting jobs in commercials, movies and TV shows. Merging her passion for the entertainment industry and aptitude for business administration and public relations, she launched Showbiz Media Services in 2003, working as a personal assistant, publicist and talent manager for both Canadian and Los Angeles-based actors, screenwriters and producers.  By 2006, Kelly was a well-respected industry insider who served as a trusted aide and confidante to some of Hollywood&apos;s most influential powerbrokers, some of them Academy Award winners. That eventually led to yet another side-career as a screenwriter, comic book writer and transmedia producer through her production company, KJC Group Entertainment, which develops tie-in materials (website content, YouTube videos, comic books, interactive games, social media contests and viral marketing campaigns) for the film and television industry. In 2008, her debut webcomic, The Black Tower, became an international success and was on the fast-track to becoming a network TV series before the economic crash sent her multi-million dollar project to the back burner.  Now semi-retired from the entertainment industry, Kelly still works as an artist and interior decorator from her home on Vancouver Island, while continuing to dabble in screenwriting, comic book writing and freelance lifestyle journalism.</biography>

      <birthName>Morse, David Bowditch</birthName>
      <biography>David Morse, a 6&apos; 4&quot; tall blue-eyed blond who performed on stage for 10 years before breaking into film, became established as a respected supporting, character actor and second lead.  He was born the first of four children to Charles and Jacquelyn Morse on October 11, 1953, in Beverly, Massachusetts. He grew up with three younger sisters. After graduating from high school, Morse studied acting at the &apos;William Esper&apos; (qv) Studio. In 1971, he began his professional acting career appearing in over 30 productions with the Boston Repertory Company from 1971 to 1977. In the late 1970s, Morse continued his stage career with the Circle Repertory Company in New York before moving into television and film. In the late 1990s, he returned to the Off-Broadway stage starring in &apos;Paula Vogel&apos; (qv)&apos;s Pulitzer Prize winning drama, &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; (1997), for which he won the Drama Desk Award and the Obie.  Morse made his big screen debut in 1980 co-starring as &quot;Jerry Maxwell&quot;, a cheerful bartender turned basketball player, opposite &apos;John Savage (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Diana Scarwid&apos; (qv) in _Inside Moves (1980)_ (qv), written by &apos;Barry Levinson (I)&apos; (qv) and directed by &apos;Richard Donner&apos; (qv). Although _Inside Moves (1980)_ (qv) was nominated for an Oscar, Morse had to wait a few years until his career took off. His big break came in 1982 when he was cast as Dr. Jack &quot;Boomer&quot; Morrison, a young doctor who struggles as a single parent after the death of his wife, in _&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (1982)_ (qv), a medical drama that ran for six seasons. He co-starred as opposite &apos;Jodie Foster&apos; (qv) and young &apos;Jena Malone&apos; (qv) in the Oscar nominated Sci-Fi drama _Contact (1997)_ (qv). In 1999, he appeared in &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Green Mile (1999)_ (qv), with &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv). A year later, he played a supporting role as a kidnapped husband of &apos;Meg Ryan&apos; (qv) in _Proof of Life (2000)_ (qv). In 2002, Morse became the first English-speaking actor nominated for the Golden Horse Award, the Chinese equivalent of the Oscars, for his superb performance as FBI expert &quot;Kevin Richter&quot; in _Shuang tong (2002)_ (qv). From 2002 to 2004, Morse had a regular gig starring as &quot;Mike Olshansky&quot;, an ex-Philadelphia policeman turned cab driver, in the TV series _&quot;Hack&quot; (2002)_ (qv) which ran three seasons and was filmed in Philadelphia, close to his home. In 2006-2007, he has a recurring role on season 3 of an Emmy award-winning medical drama _&quot;House M.D.&quot; (2004)_ (qv).  David Morse has been married to fellow actress &apos;Susan Wheeler Duff&apos; (qv) since 1982. They have three children, one daughter and twin sons. In 1994, after the the Northridge earthquake destroyed his home in Sherman Oaks, Morse moved from LA to Philadelphia with his family, and is currently residing in his wife&apos;s hometown.</biography>

      <biography>Fatimah Taliah is a film and television actress whose journey began as young local talent in Chicago. Her journey has never been easy but when dreams are obtained when doubt is replaced by determination. Fashion and film were long time fantasies that are now coming true for Fatimah Taliah. The art of entertainment has always been a passion since the age of 4. While pursuing a degree in dance and theater at Columbia College in 2004, a twist of fate turned her focus to modeling. An Elite model introduced Fatimah to a modeling agent which landed her a contract with Elite after being spotted walking in a fashion show a friend put together for his class assignment at Columbia. This came after she tried over 100 open modeling calls for the agency and was turned down every time. Destiny definitely took over for Fatimah at that moment and her resume proves it. She has walked for Jennifer Lopez, Glamorama, and Project Runways Macy&apos;s events. Her commercial catalogs include Ashley Furniture, Crème of Nature, Allstate Insurance, and Walmart; to name a few. She has done local stage plays and began her professional career entertaining as a backup dancer for R&amp;B singer, Syleena Johnson co-star of R&amp;B Divas. Although modeling swept Fatimah off into the world of fashion, she never forgot about her love for acting and found a common link between the two. Fatimah keeps balance in both art forms with preparation and planning. Acting classes, fashion magazines and blogs help her stay current on the trends in both of her crafts. She looks forward to her own line of fashion one day and would love to play the villain in a feature film. It&apos;s all in the creative process that excites her. Every success story has its setbacks. Fatimah is very aware of hers - being a brown black woman with the &quot;right look&quot; for Hollywood. She knows people go with what they know and fear taking chances. Her competition is tough. There are days she sheds tears and wants to give up, but frustration only makes Fatimah determined. So in 2012, Fatimah moved from Chicago to L.A. without looking back and signed to InfiniteSpin Management in 2013.</biography>

      <biography>Scott Adkins was born in Sutton Coldfield, England, on June 17th, 1976, into a family that for generations were Butchers. Along with his elder brother Craig, he was raised by John and Janet Adkins, a loving middle-class family. It is worth mentioning that Scott&apos;s great, great grandmother was of Spanish descent. Scott attended Bishop Vesey&apos;s Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. Probably not the best of students, he used to sneak downstairs after his parents had gone to bed and watch films all night then fall asleep during lessons. A natural athlete, Scott enjoyed a variety of sports as he grew up, but when he was 10 years old, he accompanied his father and brother to the local Judo club. The attraction was instantaneous. Idolising stars such as &apos;Bruce Lee (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jean-Claude Van Damme&apos; (qv), Scott began to train everyday. He took over his Dad&apos;s garage and turned it into his own Dojo. He even had a shrine to &apos;Bruce Lee (I)&apos; (qv) in there that he would bow to. He remembers being mugged on a bus when he was around 13 and that really kicked his training into overdrive. He wasn&apos;t ever going to let that happen again. At the age of 14, Scott went on to train in Tae Kwon Do under the instruction of Ron Sergiew with the T.A.G.B. After a few years, he moved on to Kickboxing under Anthony Jones. He is now a fully trained Kickboxing Instructor for the P.K.A. A self confessed &quot;film junkie&quot; Scott&apos;s attention was drawn to acting through the Hollywood Greats. He enrolled in a drama class at Sutton Coldfield College. Being a shy lad he initially found it difficult to be put on stage in front of an audience. Finally, at the age of 21, Scott was offered a place at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. However, as an impoverished student, he found it hard to make ends meet without a grant and was forced to leave without completing the course. Very dejected he thought that was the end.  His first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial arts film called _Dei seung chui keung (2001)_ (qv) (aka Extreme Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and director &apos;Wei Tung&apos; (qv) and English-born Hong Kong movie expert &apos;Bey Logan&apos; (qv), Adkins found himself in the East for the first time. Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema&apos;s leading action directors including &apos;Woo-ping Yuen&apos; (qv), &apos;Corey Yuen&apos; (qv), &apos;Sammo Hung Kam-Bo&apos; (qv) and the legendary &apos;Jackie Chan (I)&apos; (qv). Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in BBC&apos;s _&quot;Doctors&quot; (2000)_ (qv) filmed at Birmingham&apos;s Pebble Mill. A few episodes in BBC&apos;s _&quot;EastEnders&quot; (1985)_ (qv) and _&quot;City Central&quot; (1998)_ (qv), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama _&quot;Mile High&quot; (2003)_ (qv) followed by a regular role in BBC&apos;s _&quot;Holby City&quot; (1999)_ (qv) as Bradley Hume, the assistant General Manager of Holby General.  Starring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of Talbot in _Special Forces (2003) (V)_ (qv) and Yuri Boyka&quot; in _Undisputed II: Last Man Standing (2006)_ (qv). It was this film that broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka in what has been hailed as one of the best American made Martial Arts films of recent times. Along with lead actor &apos;Michael Jai White&apos; (qv), fight coordinator &apos;J.J. Perry&apos; (qv) and the slick direction of &apos;Isaac Florentine&apos; (qv) this movie has some unbelievably heart stopping fight scenes. After this Scott has had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv) and _The Tournament (2009)_ (qv), and played &apos;Jean-Claude Van Damme&apos; (qv)&apos;s main adversary in Sony Pictures _The Shepherd (2008) (V)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Mark currently lives in London, England with his wife Patsy and their twin boys. He also has two older daughters from a previous marriage. One of which, Sienna has followed in his footsteps into the industry.  Mark began his professional career in his late 20&apos;s in 1991 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada under the mentorship of Robin Phillips, who was at the time, Director General of the Edmonton Citadel Theatre, who cast him in Peter Shaffer&apos;s, &apos;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&apos;, playing Villac Umu (Chief Priest of the Inca Empire). Mark was also a full time police officer in the Edmonton Police Service. But that didn&apos;t deter his acting aspirations. He went on to perform in several more plays at the Citadel Theatre, before making the decision to leave the police service in early 1996, when he accepted a summer contract with Bard on the Beach, a Shakespeare Festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, performing in &apos;The Merchant of Venice&apos; and &apos;Much Ado About Nothing&apos;. Later that same year his film and television career began, where he was fortunate to work with some very good directors and actors on many interesting projects. In 2003 his adventurous nature took him back to London, England where he has continued his career, and hasn&apos;t looked back.  Mark has led an eclectic life, having also been a police officer in the Metropolitan Police Service in London, England in the early 1980&apos;s. He competed for Great Britain and Canada at bobsledding during the mid to late 1980&apos;s. Prior to this he was a track and field athlete, his main events being the 200m and 400m. But his claim to fame was winning the International Police Olympic decathlon in Austin, Texas in 1982, where he also broke the championship record.  Mark continues to look forward to more and more interesting and exciting film, television and theatre projects.</biography>

      <birthName>Costner, Kevin Michael</birthName>
      <biography>Kevin was born in Lynwood, California, on January 18, 1955, the third child of &apos;Bill Costner&apos; (qv), a ditch digger and ultimately an electric line servicer for Southern California Edison, and &apos;Sharon Costner&apos; (qv). His older brother, Dan, was born in 1950. A middle brother died at birth in 1953. His father&apos;s job required him to move regularly, which caused Kevin to feel like an Army kid, always the new kid at school, which led to him being a daydreamer. As a teen, he sang in the Baptist church choir, wrote poetry, and took writing classes. At 18, he built his own canoe and paddled his way down the rivers that Lewis &amp; Clark followed to the Pacific. Despite his present height, he was only 5&apos;2&quot; when he graduated high school. Nonetheless, he still managed to be a basketball, football and baseball star. In 1973, he enrolled at California State University at Fullerton, where he majored in business. During that period, Kevin decided to take acting lessons five nights a week. He graduated with a business degree in 1978 and married his college sweetheart, &apos;Cindy Costner&apos; (qv). He initially took a marketing job in Orange County. Everything changed when he accidentally met &apos;Richard Burton (I)&apos; (qv) on a flight from Mexico. Burton advised him to go completely after acting if that is what he wanted. He quit his job and moved to Hollywood soon after. He drove a truck, worked on a deep sea fishing boat, and gave bus tours to stars&apos; homes before finally making his own way into the films. After making one soft core sex film, he vowed to not work again if that was the only work he could do. He didn&apos;t work for nearly six years, while he waited for a proper break. That break came with _The Big Chill (1983)_ (qv), even though his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor -- he was remembered by director &apos;Lawrence Kasdan&apos; (qv) when he decided to make _Silverado (1985)_ (qv). Costner&apos;s career took off after that.</biography>

      <biography>Actor, producer, writer and director Til Schweiger is a successful filmmaker from Germany. With more than 51 Million admissions no other German filmmaker drew more people to the cinemas. He runs his own production company Barefoot Films in Berlin.  Born in Freiburg, Germany on December 19th in 1963, Til Schweiger was raised along with his two brothers in his hometown Giessen, Germany. Schweiger went on to attend University, where he studied German and Medicine. Collecting first acting experiences during this time, he decided to give up University for drama school in 1986. After graduation in 1989 he played at several theaters in Cologne and Bonn.  In front of the screen, Schweiger first appeared as an actor in 1991 in _Manta, Manta (1991)_ (qv). Supported by his mentor, Germanys biggest Filmproducer Bernd Eichinger, he had his breakthrough role in _Der bewegte Mann (1994)_ (qv). Following this role, Schweiger developed quite a fan base and began appearing on lists everywhere. His film career continued with big roles in several successful German movies.  In 1995 Schweiger married American model Dana Carlson on June 19th. A few months later their first child Valentin Florian was born.  In 1996 Schweiger was the first foreign actor who won the &quot;Polish Oscar&quot; at the International Warsaw Filmfestival for his performance in _Bandyta (1997)_ (qv). In 1997 Schweigers first daughter, Luna Marie was born. In the same year, short before Christmas, Schweiger went to a bookstore to buy presents for his family. The same did Thomas Jahn who had written several scripts. They started talking and ended up making a movie together. _Knockin&apos; on Heaven&apos;s Door (1997)_ (qv) was Schweiger&apos;s debut as a producer and (uncredited) director. The film remains a cult favorite for audiences worldwide.  In 1998 his and Danas third child, Lilli Camille was born.

In the same year Schweiger won numerous Awards for _Barfuss (2005)_ (qv) in 2005 which he wrote, directed and starred in.  This absolute artistic freedom became a prosperous model for his following projects. The most famous one was _Keinohrhasen (2007)_ (qv) which was also written, produced and directed by Schweiger and became the most successful film in German Theaters in 2008 with a box office result of USD 58.000.000. The film won a Bambi Award, a Bavarian Film Award, the German Comedy Award, two DIVA Awards, a Jupiter Award and the Ernst Lubitsch Award.  As an actor he received much attention on his big screen appearance as the legendary Hugo Stieglitz in Quentin Tarantinos _Inglourious Basterds (2009)_ (qv). During this year he achieved more admissions than any other German actor since 1968, when the FFA started counting.  His latest film and seventh work as a director, co-writer, producer and actor is called _Kokowääh (2011)_ (qv). The film is co-starring his youngest daughter Emma and a huge success in when it started in February 2011.</biography>

      <biography>Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His father had English, and some German, ancestry, while his mother&apos;s family, originally surnamed &quot;Fraga&quot;, was entirely Portuguese. Tom grew up in what he has called a &quot;fractured&quot; family. He moved around a lot after his parents&apos; divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no abuse, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He had no acting experience in college and, in fact, credits the fact that he couldn&apos;t get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. He met his second wife, actress &apos;Rita Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) on the set of his television show _&quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (1980)_ (qv) - she appeared in one episode in the second season (1981), _&quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (1980) {All You Need Is Love (#2.7)}_ (qv). They have two children, and Tom has another son and daughter by his first wife, &apos;Samantha Lewes&apos; (qv). In 1996, he made his first step behind the camera, directing and writing as well as starring in the film, _That Thing You Do! (1996)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Schuster, Joseph</birthName>
      <biography>Joe Shuster was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. At age 9 he and his family moved to Toledo, Ohio, where he met and befriended his future partner Jerome &quot;Jerry&quot; Siegel. Siegel and Shuster were both avid science fiction fans, publishing a fanzine in the mid-1920s. It was during this period that they read Philip Wylie&apos;s book, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, about a mysterious character with superpowers and invulnerability. They created a strip for their fanzine (Shuster drawing, Siegel writing) featuring a super-powered villian, but later made him into a hero. In 1936, they tried, unsuccessfully, to turn it into a daily comic strip. About the same time, both young men got a job working for DC-National (now DC Comics), working on such titles as Doctor Occult, Slam Bradley, and Radio Squad.  In 1939, DC editor Sheldon Meyer decided to give the two young men a chance, and published their character Superman a new comic title, &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Superman was an almost imediate hit, spawning his own eponymous title within a year, then going on to be featured in virtually every type of media.  Shuster and Siegel continued working on Superman for many years, but became increasingly resentful of the profits that DC-National made off their character (because of the practice at the time, the creators had signed away all rights to the character to the publisher). In 1946, Shuster and Siegel sued DC for a share of the rights to Superman (their lawyer was &apos;Albert Zugsmith&apos; (qv)). The case dragged on until 1948, when the two men settled for royalties only on the Superboy character. They were also required to sign away any future claims to the Superman character.  Shuster was bitter about his treatment, and decided to leave the comics field. In 1975, after the Superman movie raised new interest in the character, the two men once again sued DC for recognition and royalties. DC, with much prodding from publisher/editor &apos;Carmine Infantino&apos; (qv), re-instated Siegel and Shuster&apos;s name on the masthead as creators, and awarded the two men an annual stipend of $35,000. Shuster died in 1992, nearly blind and still bitter about the treatment he&apos;d received.</biography>

      <birthName>Roberts, Julia Fiona</birthName>
      <biography>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, &apos;Eric Roberts (I)&apos; (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia&apos;s biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People&apos;s Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend&apos;s Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biography>

      <biography>Eydie Gorme was born in New York on August 16, 1928 to Sephardic Jewish parents. Her father, Nessim Garmezano, was a tailor, from Sicily, who changed his last name when he arrived in the United States. Gorme began singing straight out of high school, with various big bands. But her big break came after she auditioned for, and joined, &quot;The _&quot;Tonight!&quot; (1953)_ (qv) Show&quot; in 1953. There, for $90 a week, she sang solos and sang duets with the up-and-coming &apos;Steve Lawrence (I)&apos; (qv). The two performed on the show for five years, and married in 1957. After their &quot;Tonight Show&quot; stint, the pair had a short-lived TV show of their own, _&quot;The Steve Lawrence-Eydie Gorme Show&quot; (1958)_ (qv). Then, Lawrence entered the Army leaving Gorme, a new mother, to frequent the night club circuit on her own. Two years later, when Lawrence was discharged, the couple came to a decision to enter show business more professionally. Their career took off, with audiences drawn to their penchant for the classics in favor of rock &apos;n&apos; roll, as well as their spontaneous banter.</biography>

In 1998 she won the best young actress award in the ninth `Jeune Comedien de Cinema Festival&apos; in Bezier. Then, she came to the attention of &apos;Tonie Marshall&apos; (qv) who gave her a role in her film _Vénus beauté (institut) (1999)_ (qv) for which she won a Best New Actress Cesar. It came as a surprise to even Audrey: &quot;I was so certain I could not be chosen that I told her that she probably dialled a wrong number.&quot; The director chose her for her natural nature: &quot;She came, she gaffed, she turned reddish, her ears were in a funny position and her hair was relaxed. In five minutes, she gave me the heart of the character, a petite young girl who would like to be a lady and will become a woman.&quot; In 2000, Audrey was again nominated for a Cesar and her movie _Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain (2001)_ (qv) has been a phenomenal success worldwide.</biography>

      <biography>Joey Ansah was born in 1982 in Hammersmith, London, England, 2nd in line to an older brother, Ryan, 3 years his senior. He is of mixed ethnicity, with his mother Nicola, originating from Plymouth, Devon, England and his father Kofi, originally from Ghana, west Africa. Joey grew up and spent the first 10 years of his life in Streatham, South London, attending private school first at Oakfield School and then at Dulwich College Prep. During these early years in London, his interest and enjoyment for acting and performance became evident, as he took part in all of the stage performances that were on offer. The almost obsessive interest in martial arts and action cinema began very young. As early as Joey can recount, he has memories of his father renting Action and martial arts films from the local video shop which he would avidly watch. Arnold, Stallone, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Van Damme became instinctive idols and sources of inspiration which remain to this day. Joey&apos;s family then emigrated to Accra, Ghana. This was initially a culture shock to say the least for a young Joey, who had up to this point spent most of his life in the almost exclusively white, upper-middle class environment of the English public-school system. In Accra, Joey attended Ghana&apos;s top International school for almost 5 years. During this period he was able to truly get in touch with African culture, and obtain a balanced understanding, love and pride for both halves of his heritage. Acting and stage performance continued here for a time as well. It was in Ghana that Joey&apos;s love for martial arts, dancing and stunts really took off. He joined the local Tae Kwon Do class which he trained at for 4 years. He became embroiled in the Hip Hop dance craze that was present at the school in Ghana. He also fell in love with motorbikes and began riding with friends - including the sons of an Australian former motocross champion.  A few months before his 15th birthday, Joey moved back to England (this time to Plymouth) with his mother and 1-year old sister, Tanoa. He attended Devonport High school for boys where he completed his secondary education. During this time Joey also began obsessively training for the rare Martial art of Ninjutsu with military personnel in Plymouth. After a brief stint high diving, Joey became very interested in acrobatics and tumbling, and began to develop this aspect of Ninjutsu to a very high level. After passing his A-levels, Joey moved to Oxford where he did a 3 year degree in Human biology at Oxford Brookes University. Whilst continuing to practice Ninjutsu and Acrobatics, he also took up the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira in which he has trained ever since. It was during these 3 years in Oxford that Joey began his professional work in show-business, getting work and experience wherever he could. In the first couple of years at University, Joey did his fair share of extras and walk-on parts and he saw this as a valuable opportunity to spend lots of time on varied film, TV and commercial sets, learning the film making process and more importantly watching and intently studying established actors at work. Rather than frowning upon doing extras work as many do, he viewed this as an invaluable learning period. Joey also worked as a model, both on the catwalk and in TV and print campaigns. His work in stunts also occurred at this time, working on Batman Begins as a stuntman, in addition to working as trainer and fight choreographer on the Sci-Fi series Starhyke (2006). He has used his Dance, martial arts and acrobatic abilities for various music videos and Live international shows.  Straight after graduating from University, Joey moved back to London and landed a major role in the award winning UK indie film, Lovestruck (2005). Following that he got an acting agent and his full time acting career began. Over the last 2 years he has been working consistently in a varied range of TV and film projects. With notable TV appearances as the terrorist Abbud in the hit TV show Spooks (2005) (aka MI5 in the USA), Roman emperor Geta in the prime time BBC docuseries Timewatch (2006). In 2006 Joey landed a major role in the upcoming, ground breaking UK action Feature &apos;Underground&apos;.  His big Hollywood break came in the form of him being cast in the upcoming Bourne Ultimatum (2007) by award-winning director, Paul Greengrass, in which he plays &apos;Desh&apos;, a Blackbriar super assassin working for the CIA who goes up against Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) is released in the US and UK Aug 3rd.</biography>

      <biography>CeCe Cline&apos;s career is an extraordinary life story. From her leading performances in at least six Broadway productions to her diverse film and television career, CeCe has always been one to watch. Her fascinating upbringing has contributed to her truly exceptional talent in the entertainment industry.  A gifted ballerina and singer since she could literally walk and talk, CeCe&apos;s focus at an early age appeared to be on her dancing career. Trained in various aspects of dance, including tap, jazz, hip hop, break dancing, ballroom and of course, her true love, ballet, CeCe&apos;s teachers quickly discovered that she was a dance prodigy. Just as expected, within one week of putting on her pointe shoes for the first time, CeCe had mastered pointe ballet and was capable of perfectly executing up to 10 pirouettes.  But CeCe&apos;s amazing talents did not stop with dance. She also studied classical piano and voice. When her dance classes would end, she attended voice and piano lessons. As CeCe&apos;s dance career started to excel, she put her singing career on hold, but not until she became one of the youngest performers ever to solo at Carnegie Hall. To this day, Carnegie Hall continues to invite CeCe to perform at the famous venue because of her spellbinding stage presence, fantastic voice and ability to sell out tickets.  Despite her busy childhood which was filled with performances, rehearsals and contract negotiations, CeCe managed to maintain a fairly normal childhood. She loved playing little league baseball on all boys teams, with her father serving as the team manager (he was a professional baseball player) and her mother working as the team mom. She was a school cheerleader, served on student government and was active internationally with BBYO. She excelled academically, both in her public school and with her private set tutor, and never reached below a 4.0 grade point average throughout her school career. While she learned how to balance her checkbook at the age of seven, CeCe admitted to hating math and science and preferred English and History classes.  As though this was not impressive enough, CeCe became a closet screenwriter at the age of nine. Overwhelmed by a desire to tell her own stories, CeCe had already written two screenplays by the age of 11. She, of course, had always planned to cast herself in all of her movies.  In 2004, CeCe and her friends founded the Cassiopeia Theatre Company, Inc., in Los Angeles. CeCe was desperate to perform on the stage again and was inspired by the talent among her Los Angeles friends. Their plays have opened to sold out performances, rave reviews and the Cassiopeia Theatre Company has successfully found a major fan base in the Southern California area. Under CeCe&apos;s direction as President, Cassiopeia is currently branching out into film and television production as well, and is in the process of shooting the pilot for &quot;Boarders,&quot; the true life stories of CeCe, her friend, television writer/ producer Jeny Quine and Marlene Peroutka. Cassiopeia recently produced the stage version of &quot;Boarders&quot; and was met with such a tremendously positive response from network executives and the industry&apos;s most powerful people that CeCe and her fellow producers decided to green-light the pilot shoot.  In addition to creating &quot;Boarders,&quot; CeCe recently sold two screenplays at an astounding seven figure price and will be producing those films as well. In her very limited free time, CeCe is recording another album with original music written by her and her musician friends, with CeCe accompanying herself on piano with some of the songs.  After a near-fatal car accident a few years ago, CeCe persevered as she always has in the past and had an astoundingly quick but painful recovery. In several magazine, television and newspaper interviews, CeCe has contributed her recovery to the support of her friends and family and her need to constantly rise above obstacles. Many of her accomplishments over the past few years, however have been overshadowed by her high-profile romantic relationships, including a top Calvin Klein model, a member of the South African royal family and several fellow famous actors and musicians. After the high profile relationships fizzled, she fell back in love with her high school sweetheart and first love (now a Medical Doctor) and is engaged to be married to him in late 2008.  An avid philanthropist, CeCe devotes part of her time and income to causes that are close to her heart, including organizations representing animal rights, abused kids (some of whom she has interviewed to portray in one of her many brilliant television or film appearances as an abused child), drug prevention (in memory of her close friend, the late actor Christopher Pettiet) and the Dystonia Foundation, a condition with which her own mother is living.  It appears now that CeCe Cline is unstoppable. Her keen business sense, natural born talent, electric personality, classically beautiful looks, and unquenchable drive to succeed all contribute to her phenomenal success. CeCe has several major roles in feature films and television series coming up in this year alone. She is just one starring role away from being a household name and no doubt that is what she&apos;s destined to become.</biography>

      <birthName>Sinise, Gary Alan</birthName>
      <biography>Gary Sinise was born in Blue Island, Illinois. His family later moved to Highland Park, where he attended high school. He was something of a rebel, playing in bands but paying little attention to school. Gary and some friends tried out for &quot;West Side Story&quot; as a lark, but Gary was hooked on acting for life by closing night. Gary credits his love for theatre to his drama teacher, Barbara Patterson. In 1974, Gary, &apos;Terry Kinney&apos; (qv), and &apos;Jeff Perry (I)&apos; (qv) founded the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. Initially performing in a church basement, the company grew and gained stature in the Chicago area. In addition to acting in many plays, Gary also directed some of Steppenwolf&apos;s most notable productions, including &apos;Sam Shepard&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;True West&quot;. The company made its off-Broadway debut with that production, starring Gary and &apos;John Malkovich&apos; (qv), and its Broadway debut with &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; at the Cort Theatre in 1990. Gary&apos;s Hollywood career also started in the director&apos;s chair with two episodes of the stylish TV series _&quot;Crime Story&quot; (1986)_ (qv), followed in 1988 by the feature _Miles from Home (1988)_ (qv) starring &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv). Gary&apos;s first feature film as an actor was the World War II fable _A Midnight Clear (1992)_ (qv) in 1992. That year also found Gary combining his acting and directing talents with the critically acclaimed _Of Mice and Men (1992)_ (qv). His first real notice by the public came in 1994, however. He starred in the blockbuster miniseries _&quot;The Stand&quot; (1994)_ (qv), rapidly followed by his bravura performance as &quot;Lt. Dan&quot; in _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv). His portrayal of the disabled, emotionally tortured veteran earned Gary numerous awards and an Oscar nomination. Busy 1994 was followed by busy 1995, first reuniting with &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) in _Apollo 13 (1995)_ (qv) and then starring in the HBO film _Truman (1995) (TV)_ (qv) which earned him the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards and an Emmy nomination. Gary is married to &apos;Moira Sinise&apos; (qv), an actress and original member of the Steppenwolf company. They have three children, &apos;Sophie Sinise&apos; (qv), &apos;McCanna Anthony Sinise&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ella Sinise&apos; (qv). Gary&apos;s father is the film editor &apos;Robert L. Sinise&apos; (qv), A.C.E.</biography>

      <biography>Dale Dye was born Oct. 8, 1944, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. He graduated as a cadet officer from Missouri Military Academy, but there was no money for college, so he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in January 1964. He served in Vietnam in 1965 and 1967 through 1970, surviving 31 major combat operations. He emerged from Southeast Asia with numerous decorations, including a Bronze Star for valor and three Purple Heart medals for wounds suffered in combat. He spent 13 years as an enlisted Marine, rising to the rank of master sergeant. He was chosen to attend officer candidate school and was appointed a warrant officer in 1976. He later converted his commission and was a captain when he was sent to Beirut with the multinational peacekeeping force in 1982-83. He served in a variety of assignments around the world and along the way managed to graduate with a BA degree in English from the University of Maryland. Dye worked for a year at Soldier of Fortune magazine after his retirement in 1984. He spent time in Central America, reporting and training troops in guerrilla warfare techniques in both El Salvador and Nicaragua before leaving the magazine in 1985 and heading for Hollywood. He is the founder and principal of Warriors, Inc., which provides technical advisory services to the entertainment industry worldwide. Services included performer training, research, planning, staging and on-set advisory for directors and other key production personnel.</biography>

      <biography>John Bedford Lloyd&apos;s interest in acting began accidentally, while he was a pre-med student at Williams College. A friend convinced him to take a part in a production of &quot;One Flew Over the Cookoo&apos;s Nest,&quot; and the experience changed his life. He switched his curriculum to English and began regularly performing in plays, and went on to attend Yale, graduating from that school&apos;s prestigious School of Drama.  Lloyd moved to Manhattan and began a career onstage, in film and on television in the early 1980s, generally in supporting roles. In the movies, the physically-imposing Lloyd (he is 6&apos; 5&quot; tall) is probably best known for his supporting parts in _Crossing Delancey (1988)_ (qv) and _The Abyss (1989)_ (qv). He has more recently supplemented his stage and screen work with an prolific career as a reader of audiobooks.</biography>

They were reunited with their mother after the war, but the family was destitute, and ostracised by other Germans for their father&apos;s treachery. She ended up studying textile design in Florence, where a fashion designer first asked her to model. She had first travelled to New York in 1961 as plain old Vera, but failed to secure a single booking. After retreating to Milan for a spell, she returned to take Manhattan under her new name....

      <biography>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents: a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known in fact as &quot;the hospital murderer&quot;. In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation of stories of one&apos;s line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.</biography>

      <biography>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, &quot;The Candy Store&quot;, while attending college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one&apos;s back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable &quot;tough guy&quot; performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in &quot;Extremities&quot; on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized &apos;Farrah Fawcett&apos; (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv) and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We&apos;re No Angels (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has &quot;Welcome to Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; and the afore-mentioned &quot;Extremities&quot; to his credit. Russo appeared opposite &apos;Johnny Depp&apos; (qv) in &apos;Roman Polanski&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed mobster &quot;Victor Mura&quot; in TV&apos;s short-lived, _&quot;Falcone&quot; (2000)_ (qv), the following year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv) in _Stealing Sinatra (2003)_ (qv).</biography>

He grew up in Durham in the North of England from the age of four and spent the majority of his life there. At school, he longed to be a professional footballer where he was handed a chance to join the Sunderland FC Youth Academy.

He joined New College in Durham in 2002 and studied Performing Arts for three years.

His step-mom, Dominique Passariello Cuisine, and his uncle, Vicente Passariello, invited Salomon to be present on TV sets. Salomon spent countless weekends next to his grandmother actress Gladys Cáceres.  Salomon relocated himself to Venezuela in the early 1990s. He lived in Caracas near La Carlota military airport, where he witnessed Chavez first MBR-200 coup on February 4, 1992. Several army units under Chavez&apos;s command barreled into urban Caracas assaulting and overwhelming key military and communications installations. On 27 November 1992, a second coup attempt was launched in Caracas, led by officers from the air force and navy. Salomon&apos;s apartment was damaged by both of the airstrikes.

He would finally go back to Miami, Florida on Halloween 2004.  Upon enrolling in Los Angeles Pierce College, Salomon Passariello decided to focus on acting. He would become an aspiring actor with the versatility to perform in different languages, such as English, French and Spanish.

      <biography>Chicago native Tim Griffin, often known as, &quot;the actor who is in everything,&quot; has amassed a dizzying list of credits, and over the years has solidified his reputation as one of Hollywood&apos;s nicest, most charming and versatile actors.  The son of a pediatric cardiologist, he first discovered acting after being cast as Oliver Twist in a school performance of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; As a teen Griffin would star in numerous theatrical productions for &quot;The Body Politic&quot; and &quot;New Haven Playhouse,&quot; as well local movies and commercials. After graduating from Francis Parker High School (among classmates Paul Adelstein, Anne Heche, and novelist Brad Thor), Griffin made the choice to put acting on the back-burner to enroll in the University of Vermont (UVM) where he graduated with a double major in political philosophy and English literature.  Griffin performed as a regular member of the UVM Players (as Claudio in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Riff in &quot;West Side Story&quot;). Fate intervened his sophomore year while driving back to Chicago when his car broke down outside New York City. While waiting for it to be repaired, his agents asked him to audition for a TV movie called &quot;Taking A Stand.&quot; He was cast in the leading role of the all-star production (Betty Buckley, Jane Adams, Michael Beach). The show went on to win a Daytime Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Children&apos;s Special.&quot;  Following this success, Griffin turned down a scholarship to study abroad at the University of Kent in England, and went to Hollywood. Giving himself the extreme grand total of one year to make or break his career, he enrolled in classes at UCLA and signed with Writers and Artists. He quickly went on to star in high-profile TV shows and movies of the week, including &quot;China Beach,&quot; &quot;In The Heat of the Night,&quot; and Michael Zinberg&apos;s autobiographical, coming-of-age drama &quot;For The Very First Time.&quot;  Rejecting the advice of his agents, he elected to return to the University of Vermont to finish up his Bachelor&apos;s Degree. He considered attending graduate school for political philosophy, but his academic mentor convinced him to return to the West Coast and continue to pursue his acting career, noting that the scholarly life would always be there to fall back on if &quot;things didn&apos;t pan out.&quot;  Unsure whether working as a &quot;teen actor&quot; came with an expiration date, he picked up right where he left off, landing recurring stints on &quot;General Hospital,&quot; the critically acclaimed &quot;Against The Grain&quot; (co-starring &quot;Southland&apos;s&quot; Mike Cudlitz, and Ben Affleck), and a near-unrecognizable turn as the autistic Richie Grayson on &quot;Party of Five.&quot; His reputation as a multi-talented actor began to grow, and in 1996, director John Singleton gave Griffin his first break into features, casting him in &quot;Higher Learning&quot; (Jennifer Connelly, Lawrence Fishburne) as the orientation announcer at a pep rally whose booming message was &quot;How many people came here to change the world?!&quot;  In his hilarious recurring role as T.R. Knight&apos;s brother, Ronny O&apos;Malley,&quot; on &quot;Grey&apos;s Anatomy,&quot; Griffin is best know for shooting his own dad in the butt. He became even more recognizable in 2004 when he was cast in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy,&quot; the second installment of the legendary franchise. As &quot;Nevins&quot;, a hapless CIA agent who interrogates the eerily silent Bourne (Matt Damon), he&apos;s repeatedly stonewalled and smugly says &quot;You&apos;re going to play ball one way or another...&quot; During filming, Damon (by pure accident) really cracked Griffin across the bridge of his nose, giving him a deviated septum.  Griffin&apos;s blockbuster streak continues with credits that include Jon Favreau&apos;s &quot;Iron Man,&quot; and more than a few projects for the brilliant J.J. Abrams, such as &quot;Cloverfield,&quot; &quot;Star Trek&quot;(where Abrams directed him as the doomed UFSS Kelvin&apos;s Chief Engineer in the opening sequence) and in the upcoming &quot;Super 8&quot;(Elle Fanning).  Being handpicked to star alongside and be directed by George Clooney in the 1920&apos;s football romp, &quot;Leatherheads&quot; (also starring Renee Zellweger) was a huge thrill. He re-teamed with Clooney again in the comedy &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; (featuring Academy Award winners Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges). Griffin earned critical praise for his work in Doug Liman&apos;s true-life spy drama &quot;Fair Game&quot; as Paul, the lead CIA analyst charged with the unenviable task of taking on Scooter Libby (David Andrews) over the now infamous &quot;yellow cake uranium.&quot; Starring Academy Award winner Sean Penn and Naomi Watts, &quot;Fair Game&quot; was awarded screenwriting honors by the Writer&apos;s Guild of America, and a New York Film Critics award.  In addition to multiple recognizable commercial campaigns and television spots, Griffin has a number of films hitting theaters this year, including the thriller &quot;Jacked&quot; (Maria Bello, Stephen Dorff) and independent immigration drama &quot;A Better Life&quot; (directed by Chris Weitz). He recently wrapped &quot;The Collection,&quot; the highly anticipated sequel to the horror film &quot;The Collector,&quot; written and directed by Marcus Dunstan (SAW IV, V, VI, VII, etc.).  In September 2011, Griffin will hunt for big box office game when he reunites with director John Singleton in Lionsgate&apos;s &quot;Abduction,&quot; starring Taylor Lautner as a young man on the run trying to uncover his true identity. He has also finished filming the pilot for the American reboot of the acclaimed British series &quot;Prime Suspect,&quot; starring Maria Bello and Aidan Quinn. Griffin plays wisecracking detective Augie Blando, who alongside Kirk Acevedo (&quot;Oz&quot;) and Brian O&apos;Byrne (&quot;Brotherhood&quot;) who are ringleaders of a male-dominated group of detectives who call themselves &quot;The Beef Trust.&quot; The pilot was produced and directed by Peter Berg (&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;) and is projected to be a part of NBC&apos;s Fall lineup.  Griffin lives with his wife and their two children in L.A. With his wife, he has built and remodeled several homes. He&apos;s a proud Irish-American ridiculously devoted to the Chicago Cubs.</biography>

      <biography>John was born and raised in downtown Toronto to Italian parents who made the long journey to Canada to start a new life. He first caught the acting/filmmaking bug in Grade 8. It was then that Aiko Suzuki (sister of David Suzuki) came to his class and taught a course in super 8 filmmaking. John played his first leading role as a blind boy in a film shot in the then new Spadina subway station.  Nevertheless, it would take some time and a diversion into athletics before John would return to his passion for the arts. After a typical childhood of running the streets of his neighborhood and a few scrapes with the law, John would eventually find his focus in athletics at Central Tech High School. It is there that he would take his running to the track. John would go on to be part of the record breaking 4x100m relay team alongside Olympian Atlee Mahorn. It was his speed that would catch the attention of the football team and in his senior year he would be awarded an Athletic Scholarship to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC.  It was in the Simon Fraser Theater program that John&apos;s passion for acting was ignited. John would waste no time, and after 2 years at the University John made the move to New York to join his older brother Frank to further his studies and commit to acting as a life choice. By day John studied with acclaimed acting teacher Julie Bovasso. At night John would go to what he calls &quot;one of the greatest jobs I have ever talked my way into&quot; - an usher at the renowned Vivian Beaumont Theater in the beautiful Lincoln Center. Nightly, John would seat his audiences and then get lost in the magic of the theater as he quietly perched at the top of the stairs.  John found his way back to Vancouver where he spent a few years doing plays, a variety of TV and film projects and eventually landed his first big Hollywood Feature Film- Alive.  Soon after John was in Los Angeles for the Premiere of Alive, and quickly began landing roles, resulting in a permanent move to L.A. It is there that he found what he likes to call his &quot;artistic oasis&quot;: The Actors Studio. This prestigious institution run by its current co- presidents Al Pacino, Ellen Burstyn and Harvey Keitel would soon accept John as a life time member.  John Cassini is regarded as one of Canada&apos;s most versatile and dynamic actors. This multiple Gemini Nominee (honouring the best in Canadian television) has had the distinction of playing regular series leads on both of Canada&apos;s number one television shows. John stars on the award winning and internationally acclaimed drama Intelligence, and the critically praised half hour comedy Robson Arms. It is John&apos;s ability to go from lovable hapless comedic characters, to salt of the earth dads and detectives, to ruthless organized crime figures that keep this veteran of TV, stage and film in demand.  John not only stars on Canada&apos;s most popular television series&apos;, but on international hit TV shows as well. His small screen credits include recurring roles on CBS&apos;s The Handler, Fox&apos;s Brimstone, and Stephen King&apos;s Kingdom Hospital. John has over 50 Guest Star appearances that include multiple episodes on NYPD Blue, ER, The Practice, and the new Jerry Bruckheimer CBS drama Eleventh Hour. His roles in mini-series&apos; include NBC&apos;s 10.5 and 10.5 the Apocalypse, Traffic, and Final Days of Planet Earth .  John also has an impressive list of big screen credits as well. John co-wrote, produced and starred in the award winning independent film Break A Leg starring Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Sandra Oh, Kevin Corrigan and Eric Roberts. Break A Leg went on to win over 10 Best Feature or Audience Awards at various US festivals including Best Actor for John at The Marco Island Film Festival.  His other feature film credits include: The Game, Seven, Alive, Paycheck,and Get Carter, among others. His independent films include Female Perversions , Vice, Chaos, Motorcycle Gang directed by John Milius and The Whole Shebang.  John&apos;s passion for the stage led to him co-founding the 3rd Street Theatre in Los Angeles, where he would perform in such plays as David Mamet&apos;s Edmond, Sam Shepard&apos;s, Geography of a Horse Dreamer, Harold Pinter&apos;s, One For The Road and the LA Weekly Award winning original production of They Shoot Horses Don&apos;t They?  In 2008 John took his talents to Vancouver&apos;s prestigious six-hundred seat theatre, the Stanley Stage, playing the male lead, &quot;Howie Corbett&quot; in the Pulitzer Prize winning play, Rabbit Hole.  John has dazzled audiences and reviewers alike with his acting range, having one reviewer state, &quot;It&apos;s hard to believe this is the same performer who played the steely-eyed, borderline dangerous nightclub manager in Intelligence. Leslie Nielson and Cassini&apos;s scenes together in Robson Arms are the stuff of great comedy.&quot; (Can West Service - Alex Strachan).  John has received industry acclaim throughout his career, and has been honored with a Leo award for Best Lead Actor on Robson Arms and was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Lead Actor for Intelligence. He also received a Gemini Nomination for his work on the critically acclaimed drama Davinci&apos;s Inquest.  John took on the role as producer as well as a lead actor in the feature film, &quot;Guido Superstar - In 2011 John was also a producer on the independent film &quot;Hit &apos;n Strum&quot;, which had a successful theatrical release in Canada and went on to win awards. He also produced a new film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. John also stars in &quot;The Resurrection of Tony Gitone&quot; directed by Jerry Ciccoritti which is to be theatrically released in March 2013. In the theatre world, John appeared on stage in the spring of 2012 in the play God Of Carnage at the Manitoba Theatre Centre and the Vancouver Playhouse. In 2012 John became Co-Artistic Director of Railtown Actors Studio and in 2013 he will be joining the cast as recurring characters in SyFy&apos;s hit Continuum and the critically acclaimed drama Blackstone on Showcase / APTN.</biography>

      <biography>Scott&apos;s acting career began when he was contacted by Carl Butto of Creative Talent in Las Vegas. Carl had seen him on a talk show, representing Nevada Highway Patrol, on the local PBS TV station and was impressed by his voice and screen presence. After appearing in dozens of local commercials, Scott landed the part of &quot;State Trooper&quot; on the WB TV series &quot;The Strip&quot;, his first SAG part, and later joked with Carl saying, &quot;If didn&apos;t get that part, I shouldn&apos;t be acting&quot;. He was catching the eyes of prominent Vegas casting directors, most notably, Ray Favaro and Merilee Lear and movie auditions began to come his way. Steven Soderbergh personally thanked Scott for making the Ocean&apos;s Eleven Airport Scene spectacular. As an honorably retired State Trooper, Scott gives law enforcement roles added realism and performs them flawlessly. He is sure, the best is yet to come!</biography>

      <biography>A warm and nurturing actor with quiet strength and a friendly smile, Clyde Tull was born in San Francisco, the son of an FBI agent and a homemaker. He was raised in California, Tennessee and Louisiana, a middle child with an older brother and a younger sister.  He made his acting debut when he was 14 years old, along with his future wife, in a Baton Rouge High School production of Beggar on Horseback.  Upon graduation from LSU with a degree in Finance, he volunteered for military service and enjoyed a successful 30 year career in the US Army. Serving throughout the United States and overseas, he held a variety of command and staff assignments at all levels of the Army, retiring in the grade of Colonel.  While still in the Army, Clyde made his first national television and radio commercials for Total Petroleum, thus beginning his professional acting career.  Moving to Los Angeles in 2000, Clyde was cast in the film S1mOne, playing a Catholic Cardinal opposite Al Pacino. In 2002, he became nationally known as the chatty Texan in a popular Budweiser spot highlighted on the Super Bowl. Directed by Allen Coulter, this spot won a Clio, three AICP awards and an Emmy nomination. Popular and endearing, Clyde&apos;s character was brought back the following year for another Super Bowl spot for Budweiser, this time featuring Tim McGraw.  Clyde continues to play a wide array of characters in movies, television and commercials. He has most recently appeared opposite Eddie Izzard on The Riches and opposite Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel on How I Met Your Mother. A true raconteur, he is prized for roles in which his down to earth personality can bring an upbeat spark to a project.</biography>

      <birthName>Manoux, Jean-Paul Christophe</birthName>
      <biography>J.P. Manoux grew up on the beaches of Santa Barbara, California, the oldest of seven. He was involved in children&apos;s theatre productions and took tap dance lessons before attending the Thacher School in Ojai, California. Curiously, that tiny boarding school would provide no less than 3 doctors for NBC&apos;s long running hospital drama ER (Noah Wyle and Leland Orser, the other two). As college applications approached, Manoux&apos;s drama teacher recommended the undergraduate theatre department at Northwestern University.  Surrounded by Chicago&apos;s vibrant theatre scene, J.P. became passionate about improv and sketch comedy. Upon graduating and moving to Hollywood, he sharpened his own comedy chops at L.A. Theatresports, ACME Comedy Theatre, The Groundlings School, and I.O. West. Legit stage productions garnered critical accolades, culminating in 1999 with L.A. Ovation and Backstage West Garland Awards recognizing his work in the world premiere stage musical Reefer Madness.  Over the next few years, J.P. appeared in dozens of TV sitcoms and national commercials including campaigns for Got Milk? and Fruit of the Loom. He was a regular improviser and sketch player on ABC&apos;s 2001 prime-time variety experiment The Wayne Brady Show and he became a celebrity in the world of children&apos;s television thanks to his dual role as &quot;Mr. Hackett&quot; and &quot;Curtis the Caveman&quot; on the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future. During this period, he also voiced the lead role of &quot;Kuzco&quot; in Disney&apos;s animated series The Emperor&apos;s New School. In 2006, J.P. joined the ensemble of ER, recurring as surgical resident Dustin Crenshaw. It would prove to be a shrewd casting move, widely regarded (in the Manoux household) as the single most significant factor in returning the venerable series to its original acclaim, prestige, and sex appeal.  Opportunities to act and direct in Canada led Manoux to pursue immigration north of the border. The Toronto based productions of DisneyXD&apos;s sci-fi/adventure series Aaron Stone and Teletoon&apos;s hybrid animation comedy series Mud pit saw him working both in front of and behind the camera. Still a U.S. citizen, but now a permanent resident of Canada, Manoux routinely hops the border for film and television work, including his recurring role on Community as &quot;The Deanelganger&quot;. He hopes to continue spending summers in Toronto, acting in the new CTV multi-camera sitcom Spun Out which stars Dave Foley of The Kids in the Hall and Newsradio fame.  J.P. Manoux has appeared in over 30 feature films, 90 different television series, and 90 commercials. He has provided voice and motion capture performance for 8 video games, competed as a contestant or celebrity panelist on 6 gameshows, read 2 original pieces for All Things Condsidered on National Public Radio, co-written 1 play, and anonymously authored 1 biography.</biography>

      <biography>Derek was born in London and from an early age was fascinated with film and TV. He would regularly entertain friends and family with his impersonations of famous actors of the day. He attended a local theatre school later in his teens.  Derek was fortunate enough to meet the stage and screen actor Sir Nigel Hawthorne, who was a close neighbour and friend, and encouraged him to think about working within the acting profession and generously agreed to sponsor his application to join British Actor&apos;s Equity.  Derek worked on the first Star Wars film, &apos;A New Hope&apos; in 1976 - this was in fact his first job within the film business. He was chosen to appear as a Medal Bearer and Massassi Guard at the end of the film.  From this start, Derek has been able to cultivate his career in film, winning parts in many major films made in England, including, Flash Gordon, Krull, The Living Daylights, Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade plus many others. He has also worked on TV productions and was PC Craig Lovell in The Bill from 1987 to 1991. He has rubbed shoulders with many great actors, including Robert Mitchum, Julie Andrews, Jack Nicholson, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir Laurence Olivier, John Rhys-Davies and most recently Alec Baldwin. Derek was a close friend of the late Marvin Gaye, whilst the singer was recording his last album for Motown, `In Our Lifetime&apos;, in London.</biography>

      <biography>George Corley Wallace (August 25, 1919 - September 13, 1998), elected Governor of Alabama as a Democrat four times (1962, 1970, 1974 &amp; 1982) and four-time candidate for President (1964, 1968, 1972 &amp; 1976). Though he is best known for his belligerent defense of segregation, going so far as to block the door of the University of Alabama to prevent its desegregation under federal fiat, he mellowed with age and reached out to African Americans during the 1970s.  Wallace&apos;s public racism was rooted in his defeat in his first gubernatorial race in 1958, when he was portrayed as the liberal candidate and soft on segregation. Wallace vowed he would &quot;never be out-niggered again&quot; and won in 1962. He proceeded to keep that promise, publicly defying the Kennedy Administration until being knuckled under by fellow southerner &apos;Lyndon Johnson (I)&apos; (qv).  After a stab at the Democratic presidential nomination in 1964 as a protest candidate, in 1968 Wallace ran the most successful Third-Party challenge between &apos;Theodore Roosevelt&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Bull Moose&quot; campaign of 1912 and &apos;Ross Perot&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Reform Party&quot; movement of 1992 when he ran for President as a &quot;law and order&quot; candidate (code word for being tough on African Americans) on the American Independent ticket. He won five states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, &amp; Mississippi) and 46 electoral votes, and it was feared at one point during Election Night that his success might throw the election into the House of Representatives.</biography>

      <biography>A native of the South Bronx, Frank John Hughes studied Jazz composition at the Berklee College of Music in Boston before moving back to New York to begin studying with legendary Russian method acting teacher Sonia Moore at her Studio of the Theatre. At the age of nineteen he became one of the youngest members ever to be given lifetime membership into New York&apos;s prestigious Actor&apos;s Studio.  In 1988, after stage productions Off-Broadway, Hughes made his feature film debut in Robert Celestino&apos;s True Convictions. Hughes and Celestino would next collaborate in 1997 on the Sundance Film Festival hit Mr. Vincent. Since then Hughes has appeared in films such as Bad Boys opposite Will Smith, The Funeral, Layin&apos; Low, Urban Jungle, Robbers, Deranged, for which he won best actor at the New York Independent Film Festival, Steven Spielberg&apos;s Catch Me If You Can opposite Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, &apos;Yonkers Joe&apos; and Righteous Kill opposite Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.  A veteran of numerous television appearances, Mr. Hughes received wide international acclaim for his portrayal of Wild Bill Guarnere in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers and in 2007 joined the cast of HBO&apos;s The Sopranos for the show&apos;s final season playing Walden Belfiore.  In 2008, Hughes joined the cast of the hit series 24 as Director of Homeland Security Tim Woods and remained for the final two seasons until the series ended.  In 2010, Hughes wrote, produced and starred in the film &apos;Leave&apos; opposite Rick Gomez, Bryan Cranston and Ron Livingston. It was directed once again, by his long time collaborator Robert Celestino. &apos;Leave&apos;, which won both &apos;best feature&apos; and the &apos;audience award&apos; at the Gasparilla International Film Festival, will be released in 2012.  In 2011, Hughes wrote and produced &apos;The Grief Tourist&apos; staring Michael Cudlitz, Melanie Griffith and Pruitt Taylor Vince. It is set for release in late 2012.  Hughes is co-founder of Reckoner Films along with Rick Gomez.</biography>

      <biography>Barnabas Reti has become well-known in Hungary for his ongoing lead role in Baratok kozt, the country&apos;s number 1 TV-series as Erik, a romantic male-lead and bad-boy of Hungarian daytime-TV. He was born in 1982, in Szeged, Hungary. As a very impressive talent in drawing and painting, everybody thought he was going to be a painter or a graphic artist. Although he used to do illustrations for local newspapers as a teenager, his real passion for acting and movies led him to try drama school after the age of 18. He went to Budapest to learn acting and started to work in several theaters. He was first chosen by Peter Greenaway to play a young fascist soldier in his actual film shot on location in Hungary. Another minor on-screen role followed in Being Julia by Academy Award-winner Hungarian director Istvan Szabo where Barnabas played Bruce Greenwood&apos;s gay lover. After 3 years of intensive stage training in Budapest, he traveled to the United States to attend an acting for film course at the New York Film Academy. Returning back to Europe he started his own theatre company with young artists and made his critically acclaimed debut as a director with Tennessee Williams&apos; The Glass Menagerie where he also did the leading role as Tom, the poet. The show toured in Romania and Hungary with great reviews. Then he was invited to Baratok kozt, the most popular TV-show in Hungary for a 3 year-contract witch made him famous and popular countrywide. As a well-known Tv-star he carried on acting on stage in dramas, comedies and musicals and has been continuously working with his theater group becoming a fresh new point of the underground theatre scene of Budapest. Their production of Stephen King&apos;s Misery with him as the male lead has became such a hit success that it went from a small studio to Karinthy Theatre, one of the most popular stages of Budapest. He has played various characters on stage in plays of different genres from drama to comedy. The title role of Albert Camus&apos; classic &apos;Caligula&apos; was his last Hungarian performance before he moved to London to seek for more international opportunities. Recently he played infamous murderer and novelist Krytian Bala in Sky Vision&apos;s upcoming TV crime-docu series &apos;Killers - Behind the Myth&apos;.</biography>

      <biography>Cate Blanchett was born on May 14, 1969 in Australia to an American father and an Australian mother. She has an older brother and an younger sister. When she was ten years old, her 40-year old father died of a sudden heart attack. Her mother never remarried, and her grandmother moved in to help her mother. Cate graduated from Australia&apos;s National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992 and, in a little over a year, had won both critical and popular acclaim. On graduating from NIDA, she joined the Sydney Theatre Company&apos;s production of &apos;Caryl Churchill&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Top Girls&quot;, then played Felice Bauer, the bride, in &apos;Tim Daly (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Kafka Dances&quot;, winning the 1993 Newcomer Award from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle for her performance. From there, Blanchett moved to the role of Carol in &apos;David Mamet (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s searing polemic &quot;Oleanna&quot;, also for the Sydney Theatre Company, and won the Rosemont Best Actress Award, her second award that year. She then co-starred in the ABC Television&apos;s prime time drama _&quot;Heartland&quot; (1994)_ (qv), again winning critical acclaim. In 1995, she was nominated for Best Female Performance for her role as Ophelia in the Belvoir Street Theatre Company&apos;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

She made her feature film debut in _Paradise Road (1997)_ (qv). She also married writer &apos;Andrew Upton&apos; (qv) in 1997. She had met him a year earlier on a movie set, and they didn&apos;t like each other at first. He thought she was aloof, and she thought he was arrogant, but then they connected over a poker game at a party, and she went home with him that night. Three weeks later he proposed marriage and they quickly married before she went off to England to play her breakthrough role in films: the title character in _Elizabeth (1998)_ (qv) for which she won numerous awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. Cate was also nominated for an Academy Award for the role but lost out to &apos;Gwyneth Paltrow&apos; (qv). 2001 was a particularly busy year, with starring roles in _Bandits (2001)_ (qv), _The Shipping News (2001)_ (qv), _Charlotte Gray (2001)_ (qv) and playing Elf Queen Galadriel in the &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy.

Two years later, she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for playing a teacher having an affair with an underage student in &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2006).

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Escalante Lundy is an American film and television actor and producer, from New Orleans, LA. His most notable role is as &quot;Big Fred&quot; in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Oscar-Nominated film, Django Unchained. Lundy also appears as a prison guard in HBO&apos;s Emmy-Nominated television series Treme and in a Pampers commercial with Super Bowl Championship Quarterback, New Orleans Saints&apos; Drew Brees.  Escalante Lundy was born in New Orleans, LA the eldest of five brothers, to Merline (nee&apos; Roy), retired real estate agent, of Rayne, LA, and Hughes Banks Lundy, a salesman from Innis, LA. Lundy graduated from St. Augustine High School, later receiving his Bachelor&apos;s degree in Urban Planning from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Lundy received Masters degrees in Urban Planning and Geographic Information Systems from the University of New Orleans.  Escalante&apos;s career began as a stage producer in Sacramento, CA. When an actor failed to show-up, Lundy took the role&apos;, garnered success and later decided to focus on acting as a career path. Admittedly, shy by nature, Lundy used acting as a tool to face his fears of public speaking and improve his diction. He continued to hone his acting skills by taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy&apos;s family members were victims of Hurricane Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate. As the city began to rebuild, Lundy continued to pursue his new found acting passions including focusing on film roles. He studied with renowned acting coaches Veleka Grey (Young and the Restless), Lance Nichols (Curious Case of Benjamin Button and HBO Television Series, Treme) and became a fixture at the acclaimed Jerry Katz Joint (Ivana Chubback Technique). In 2007, Lundy joined the made his New Orleans theatrical debut as co-lead in the production of the &quot;Papaya Man&quot; with the Anthony Bean Community Theater (ABCT)in New Orleans. After having a challenging first rehearsal Lundy says, &quot;I tried to quit but Mr. Bean wouldn&apos;t let me. He gave me legs until I was able to run&quot;  In 2012, Lundy made his major motion picture debut as &quot;Big Fred&quot; in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s spaghetti western, Django Unchained. Lundy&apos;s role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting. Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.</biography>

      <biography>Blue-eyed Vincent Cassel was born in Paris to a leading French actor father, &apos;Jean-Pierre Cassel&apos; (qv) and a journalist mother. Often labeled as a tough guy because of his roles, eclectic choices and talent have made of him a star of European cinema. First in _La haine (1995)_ (qv), the young actor, actually coming from upper classes, succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation, (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group). Then the success of The crimson rivers, where he plays a young French cop alongside &apos;Jean Reno (I)&apos; (qv), made of him &quot;the man to count on.&quot; He never hid his taste for rap music, break dance, Capoeira, Brasil and his endless energy, but Vincent is also a family man, married to &apos;Monica Bellucci&apos; (qv), his Italian co-star from _L&apos;appartement (1996)_ (qv) (aka The Apartment); and recently a father.</biography>

      <biography>The exotically beautiful Eglantine Rembauville was born in France twenty-four years ago and began her TV career five years ago aged nineteen. Thus far she has been able to work on both sides of the English Channel and has recently made four episodes in the long-running classic series, The Bill, where she played the young wife of a charming crook played by ex-pat American Michael Brandon (married to Glynis Barber since 1989).  It seems only a matter of time before Eglantine breaks into movies, or lands a leading TV role which captures not only her stunning looks and very sexy voice, but her fine range and acting ability. Her roles apart from her involvement in the execrable Da Vinci Code, show what a fine actor she is and how much better she will be when given stronger and larger movie roles.</biography>

      <birthName>McCullough, Bernard Jeffrey</birthName>
      <biography>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo&apos; Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who&apos;s the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _&quot;Midnight Mac&quot; (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable &apos;Spike Lee&apos; (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don&apos;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _&quot;Moesha&quot; (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac&apos;s star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring &apos;Eddie Murphy (I)&apos; (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence&apos;s uncle in _What&apos;s the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _&quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac&apos;s health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biography>

      <birthName>Lennon, John Winston</birthName>
      <biography>John Winston (later Ono) Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, in Liverpool, England. In the mid-1950s he formed his first band, The Quarrymen (after Quarry Bank High School, which he attended) who, with the addition of &apos;Paul McCartney&apos; (qv) and &apos;George Harrison (I)&apos; (qv), later became &apos;The Beatles&apos; (qv). After some years of performing in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, &quot;Beatlemania&quot; erupted in England and Europe in 1963 after the release of their singles &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. The next year the Beatles flew to America to appear on _&quot;Toast of the Town&quot; (1948)_ (qv) (aka The Ed Sullivan Show), and Beatlemania spread worldwide. &apos;Queen Elizabeth II&apos; (qv) granted all four Beatles M.B.E. medals in 1965, for import revenues from their record sales; John returned his four years later, as part of an antiwar statement. John and the Beatles continued to tour and perform live until 1966, when protests over his calling the Beatles phenomenon &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot; and the frustrations of touring made the band decide to quit the road. They devoted themselves to studio work, recording and releasing albums such as &quot;Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; and the &quot;White Album&quot;. Instead of appearing live, the band began making their own &quot;pop clips&quot; (an early term for music videos), which were featured on television programs of the time. In the late 1960s John began performing and making albums with his second wife &apos;Yoko Ono (I)&apos; (qv), as the Beatles began to break up. Their first two albums, &quot;Two Virgins&quot; and &quot;Life With The Lions&quot;, were experimental and flops by Beatles standards, while their &quot;Wedding Album&quot; was almost a vanity work, but their live album &quot;Live Peace In Toronto&quot; became a Top Ten hit, at the end of the 1960s. In the early 1970s John and Yoko continued to record together, making television appearances and performing at charity concerts. After the release of John&apos;s biggest hit, &quot;Imagine&quot;, they moved to the US, where John was nearly deported because of his political views (a late-&apos;60s conviction for possession of hashish in the U.K. was the excuse given by the government), but after a four-year legal battle he won the right to stay. In the midst of this, John and Yoko separated for over a year; John lived in Los Angeles with personal assistant &apos;May Pang&apos; (qv), while Yoko dated guitarist &apos;David Spinozza&apos; (qv). When John made a guest appearance at &apos;Elton John&apos; (qv)&apos;s Thanksgiving 1974 concert, Yoko was in the audience, and surprised John backstage. They reconciled in early 1975, and Yoko soon became pregnant. After the birth of their son &apos;Sean Lennon (I)&apos; (qv), John settled into the roles of &quot;househusband&quot; and full-time daddy, while Yoko became his business manager; both appeared happy in their new life together. After a five-year break from music and the public eye, they made a comeback with their album &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;, but within weeks of their re-emergence, Lennon was murdered by &apos;Mark David Chapman&apos; (qv), a onetime Beatles fan angry and jealous over John&apos;s ongoing career.</biography>

      <biography>Harry Joseph Lennix--born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 16, 1964, to Lillian and Harry Lennix--was not always certain he wanted to be an actor. Always an A student, he decided to act in his high school&apos;s play while he waited for the baseball season to begin. From this bloomed a veritable bevy of movies and guest-starring roles in many popular television shows such as _&quot;ER&quot; (1994)_ (qv), _&quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; (1993)_ (qv), _&quot;Century City&quot; (2004)_ (qv), and most recently, _&quot;House M.D.&quot; (2004)_ (qv). Lennix attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he was recognized in &quot;Who&apos;s Who Among American College Students.&quot; He majored in Acting and Direction at Northwestern and upon graduation stayed teaching in Chicago for a bit, before moving to New York, and from there to Los Angeles, California.  Harry has two older brothers and an older sister, and often returns to Chicago to visit his remaining family there. He currently resides in Los Angeles and has recently finished work on several movies. He will be participating in the play &quot;Permanent Collection,&quot; in Los Angeles, in which he acted in Chicago, in March of 2005.</biography>

      <birthName>Roth, Eli Raphael</birthName>
      <biography>Eli Roth began shooting Super 8 films at the age of eight, after watching Ridley Scott&apos;s _Alien (1979)_ (qv) and vomiting, and deciding he wanted to be a producer/director. With his brothers and friends, ketchup for blood and his father&apos;s power tools, he made over fifty short films before attending film school at N.Y.U., where he won a student Academy Award and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1994. He worked in film and theater production in New York City for many years, doing every job from production assistant to assistant editor to assistant to the director. At the age of 20 Roth was development head for producer Fred Zollo, a position he soon left to write full time. To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films _A Price Above Rubies (1998)_ (qv) and _Illuminata (1998)_ (qv) and often worked as a stand-in, where he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that would eventually become _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) with friend &apos;Randy Pearlstein&apos; (qv), and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for his animation series _&quot;Chowdaheads&quot; (1999)_ (qv). Roth and friend &apos;Noah Belson&apos; (qv) (_Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv)&apos;s Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth produced, directed and designed. The episodes were due to run on W.C.W.&apos;s #1 rated series _&quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; (1995)_ (qv) but the C.E.O. was fired a day before they were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up a stop motion series called _The Rotten Fruit (2003) (V)_ (qv) which he produced, directed and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director &apos;David Lynch (I)&apos; (qv), producing content for the website davidlynch.com. In 2001, Roth filmed _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) on a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his producers raised from friends and family. The film was the subject of a bidding war at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion&apos;s Gate, instantly doubling their investors&apos; money. It went on to not only be the highest grossing film for Lion&apos;s Gate in 2003, but the most profitable horror film released that year, garnering critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers as &apos;Peter Jackson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) and &apos;Tobe Hooper&apos; (qv) . Roth used the film&apos;s success to launch a slew of projects, including Scavenger Hunt, a teen comedy he will write and direct for Universal Studios, and The Box, a horror thriller he is co-writing with &apos;Richard Kelly (I)&apos; (qv) that Roth will also direct. In May of 2003, Roth joined forces with filmmakers &apos;Boaz Yakin&apos; (qv), &apos;Scott Spiegel (I)&apos; (qv), and Greenestreet Films in New York to form Raw Nerve, LLC, a new production company that will produce 3-5 intense, scary, lower budget horror films annually.</biography>

      <biography>French-American character actress Lilyan Chauvin is one perhaps one of many actors or actresses that you know the face, but do not know the name. Chauvin is a long time veteran of the European stage, and is adept at playing strict, but sometimes loving characters. To horror fans, she might be best known as the sinister Mother Superior in Silent Night Deadly Night (1984), but her career started back in the 1950s when she was plucked from the stage to appear in small minor roles in motion pictures. One notable film was with John Wayne in North to Alaska (1960). Over the past thirty years, Chauvin has found herself as one of the busiest character actresses in Hollywood appearing in over forty films and numerous appearances on television. Her many film credits have included &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;, &quot;Predator 2&quot;, &quot;No Place to Hide&quot;, &quot;Universal Solider&quot; (as Jean-Claude Van Damme&apos;s mother) and most recently co-starred with Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio in Steven Spielberg&apos;s &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;.</biography>

Shaobo was rehearsing with the Peking Acrobats when he was spotted and asked to audition for the role of Yen.  Born in Guangxi, China in 1982, Shaobo saw his first acrobat performance at the age of eleven and knew immediately that was the career he wanted to pursue. Ironically, that summer when his family enrolled him in an acrobat school, he ran away after only two days. It took three more tries before he found the courage to stay enrolled and pursue the intense training. While he was still at the camp, Shaobo was seen and scouted by a troop manager for the Peking Acrobats. He eventually came to the United States where he trains in Los Angeles for the company&apos;s international tours.</biography>

      <biography>Sonny Shroyer was born in Valdosta, Georgia, a small town on the Georgia-Florida border. Shroyer, whose given name is Otis Burt Shroyer Jr., grew up steeped in the traditions of the deep South. He worked in the tobacco warehouses pushing tobacco buggies and helped his father in their fruit stand-ice cream parlor business. His prowess in high school football landed him a football scholarship at Florida State University (he later ended up playing football in the movie _The Longest Yard (1974)_ (qv) with another FSU football player, &apos;Burt Reynolds (I)&apos; (qv)). However, his football career was cut short by an injury, and Shroyer finished his education at the University of Georgia, where he earned his degree in business.  In 1961 he posed in football gear for a photographer who was shooting pictures for the back cover of the program for the Georgia-Georgia Tech football game. That picture launched his professional career. After many more print ads and commercials, Sonny landed his first movie roles in _Sixteen (1973)_ (qv) with &apos;Mercedes McCambridge&apos; (qv) and _Payday (1973)_ (qv) with &apos;Rip Torn&apos; (qv). His movie career blossomed with many more films, including _Gator (1976)_ (qv), _The Lincoln Conspiracy (1977)_ (qv), _The Million Dollar Dixie Deliverance (1978) (TV)_ (qv), _Smokey and the Bandit (1977)_ (qv), _They Went That-A-Way &amp; That-A-Way (1978)_ (qv) and a TV miniseries, _Freedom Road (1979) (TV)_ (qv). While working on &quot;Freedom Road,&quot; Shroyer, who had gained quite a reputation for playing a &quot;bad guy&quot;, was cast in the role of &quot;Enos,&quot; the big-grinned, bumbling, dipstick deputy of _&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (1979)_ (qv) television series. His popularity on the show prompted Warner Brothers and CBS to spin him off into his own series, _&quot;Enos&quot; (1980)_ (qv). &quot;Enos&quot; ran 17 episodes and was nominated for two &quot;Peoples Choice&quot; awards, and for Shroyer as &quot;Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Program.&quot;  Shroyer remains active in a variety of television network appearances and feature films. Appearances of note have been in the Emmy-winning NBC hit television series _&quot;I&apos;ll Fly Away&quot; (1991)_ (qv), where he played bigoted, abusive father Bobby Slocum, and as a possessed ex-deputy sheriff in the television series _&quot;American Gothic&quot; (1995)_ (qv). He has played a smooth-talking ladies man in a _&quot;Love Boat: The Next Wave&quot; (1998)_ (qv) episode and a murderer-rapist in _&quot;Today&apos;s F.B.I.&quot; (1981)_ (qv). Additionally, his credits include television appearances as a disturbed parent on _&quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1988)_ (qv). He also played University of Alabama head coach Bear Bryant Paramount&apos;s smash hit _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv) with &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv).  Sonny makes numerous benefit appearances, helping out with projects such as the Los Angeles Special Olympics, Muscular Dystrophy, The Cystic Fibrosis Telethon, and the American Cancer Society. He also assisted the &quot;Get High On Life, Not Drugs,&quot; sponsored by the Boston Police Department, and recently made a film called &quot;Methamphetamine: Terrorist Attack in South Georgia&quot; produced by friend Bob Brabham. He recently completed a movie called _A Tale About Bootlegging (2005)_ (qv), an independent comedy for the whole family. He plays a small town sheriff in the mountains of North Carolina.  When free from public appearances and film or television commitments, he returns to his hometown of Valdosta, where he lives with his wife, Paula.</biography>

      <birthName>Orozco, Alfonso Cuarón</birthName>
      <biography>Alfonso Cuarón Orozco was born on November 28th in Mexico City, Mexico. From an early age, he yearned to be either a film director or an astronaut. However, he did not want to enter the army, so he settled for directing. He didn&apos;t receive his first camera until his twelfth birthday, and then immediately started to film everything he saw, showing it afterwards to everyone. In his teen years, films were his hobby. Sometimes he said to his mother he would go to a friend&apos;s home, when in fact he would go to the cinema. His ambition was to know every theatre in the city. Near his house there were two studios, Studios Churubusco and Studios 212. After finishing school, Cuarón decided to study cinema right away. He tried to study at C.C.C. (Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica) but wasn&apos;t accepted because at that time they weren&apos;t accepting students under twenty-four years old. His mother didn&apos;t support that idea of cinema, so he studied philosophy in the morning and in the afternoon he went to the C.U.E.C. (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos). During that time he met many people who would later become his collaborators and friends. One of them was &apos;Luis Estrada (I)&apos; (qv). Cuaron also became good friends with &apos;Carlos Marcovich&apos; (qv) and &apos;Emmanuel Lubezki&apos; (qv). Luis Estrada directed a short called &quot;Vengance is Mine&quot;, on which Alfonso and Emmanuel collaborated. The film was in English, a fact which bothered many teachers of the C.U.E.C. such as &apos;Marcela Fernández Violante (I)&apos; (qv). The disagreement caused such arguments that in 1985, Alfonso was expelled from the university.  During his time studying at C.U.E.C. he met &apos;Mariana Elizondo&apos; (qv), and with her he had his first son, &apos;Jonás Cuarón&apos; (qv). After Alfonso was expelled, he thought he could never be a director and so went on to work in a Museum so he could sustain his family. One day, &apos;José Luis García Agraz&apos; (qv) and Fernando CáMara went to the museum and made an offer to Cuarón. They asked him to work as cable person in &quot;_La víspera (1982)_ (qv)&quot;, a job which was to prove to be his salvation. After that he was assistant director in Garcia Agraz&apos;s &quot;_Nocaut (1984)_ (qv)&quot;, as well as numerous other films.  He was also second unit director in &quot;_Gaby: A True Story (1987)_ (qv)&quot;, and co-wrote and directed some episodes in the series &quot;_&quot;A Hora Marcada&quot; (1967)_ (qv)&quot;. One New Year&apos;s Eve, he decided he would not continue to be an assistant director, and with his brother Carlos started writing what would be his first feature film: &quot;_Sólo con tu pareja (1991)_ (qv)&quot; (Love in the time of Hysteria). After the screenplay was written, the problem became how to get financial backing for the movie. I.M.C.I.N.E. (Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia), which supports movies financially, had already decided which projects it would support that year, much to Alfonso&apos;s initial chagrin. However, the director of one of those already-chosen projects was unable to direct it, so his project was canceled, and &quot;Sólo con tu pareja&quot; took its place. Despite this being chosen, there was a lot of tension between Alfonso and the I.M.C.I.N.E. executives. Nevertheless, after the movie was finished, it was a huge success. In Toronto festival the films won many awards, and Alfonso started to be noticed by Hollywood producers. &apos;Sydney Pollack&apos; (qv) was the first one to invite him to shoot in Hollywood. He proposed a feature film to be directed by Alfonso, but the project didn&apos;t work and was canceled. Alfonso moved to Los Angeles without anything concrete, and stayed with some friends, as he had no money. Soon after that, Pollack called him again to direct an episode called &quot;_&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1993) {Murder, Obliquely (#1.5)}_ (qv)&quot; of the series &quot;_&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1993)_ (qv)&quot;, that was the first job he had in U.S., and also the first time he worked with &apos;Alan Rickman&apos; (qv).  After a while, and no real directing jobs, Alfonso wanted to direct something as he needed money. He finally signed a contract with Warner Brothers to direct the film _Addicted to Love (1995) (V)_ (qv). However, one night, he read the screenplay for another film, _A Little Princess (1995)_ (qv) and fell in love with it. He talked to Warner Brothers and after some meetings he gave up directing &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; in order to do &quot;A Little Princess&quot;. Even thought it wasn&apos;t a great box office success, the film received two nominations for the Oscars, and won many other awards. After &quot;A Little Princess&quot; Alfonso developed a project with &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv) starring. The project was canceled, but Cuarón got an offer from Twentieth Century Fox to direct the modern adaptation of the Charles Dickens&apos; classic _Great Expectations (1998)_ (qv). He initially didn&apos;t want to direct it but the studio insisted, and in the end he accepted it. The experience was very painful and difficult for him mainly because there was never a definitive screenplay.  He then reunited with producer &apos;Jorge Vergara (I)&apos; (qv) and founded both Anhelo Productions and Moonson Productions. Anhelo&apos;s first picture was also Alfonso&apos;s next film, the erotic road movie &quot;_Y tu mamá también (2001)_ (qv)&quot;, which was a huge success. During the promotion of the film in Venice, Alfonso met the cinema critic &apos;Annalisa Bugliani&apos; (qv). They started dating and married that same year. &quot;_Children of Men (2006)_ (qv)&quot; was to be Alfonso&apos;s next film, a futuristic, dystopian story. During the preproduction of the film, Warner Brothers invited Alfonso to direct the third Harry Potter film, &quot;_Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)_ (qv)&quot;, an offer which he accepted after some consideration. The film would prove to be the greatest box office success of his career.  In 2003, he had a daughter named &apos;Tess Bu Cuarón&apos; (qv), and in February 2005 another son, called Olmo Teodoro Cuarón. Alfonso Cuarón signed a three-year first-look deal with Warner Brothers, which allowed his films to be distributed world-wide. As a result of that deal, he developed two new projects, _History of Love, The (2007)_ and _Memory of Running, The (2007)_. He also developed another Mexican film &quot;_México &apos;68 (2007)_&quot;, about the violent students&apos; revolt that happened in Mexico in 1968. He directed one five-minute segment of the anthology film _Paris, je t&apos;aime (2006)_ (qv) with &apos;Nick Nolte&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ludivine Sagnier&apos; (qv). His next project, the futuristic film _Children of Men (2006)_ (qv) with &apos;Clive Owen (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Julianne Moore&apos; (qv) and &apos;Michael Caine (I)&apos; (qv) premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 having been nominated for three Academy Awards. After his youngest son was diagnosed with autism and the divorce from Annalisa Bugliani he took a break from directing and settled in London where he plans to work on his next projects.  In 2013, Alfonso directed the space thriller _Gravity (2013)_ (qv), which would go win 7 academy awards.</biography>

      <biography>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _&quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot; (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor&apos;s degree.  Affleck&apos;s first major film role was in &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv)&apos;s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law &apos;Joaquin Phoenix&apos; (qv) and &apos;Nicole Kidman&apos; (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv) co-wrote with &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv) and &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean&apos;s Eleven&apos;s ensemble cast. Affleck&apos;s character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed &apos;Joaquin Phoenix&apos; (qv) in the &quot;hoax-umentary&quot; _I&apos;m Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain&apos;t Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married &apos;Summer Phoenix&apos; (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biography>

      <biography>Robert Curtis Brown has forged a career playing unique, diverse and interesting characters. This talented, Yale-trained actor has an intriguing, accessible screen presence and a depth of feeling and humor. The complexity that Robert brings to his characters may have its origins in his upbringing in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, his years at Yale College, his education at The Yale School of Drama or his experiences traveling the world for work and pleasure. Regardless, since his first professional role fresh out of Yale, Robert has tapped into the ability to embody the essence of whatever character he portrays. From his early work in New York with &apos;Joseph Papp&apos; (qv), &apos;David Hare (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv), &apos;Martin Sheen&apos; (qv), &apos;Kate Nelligan&apos; (qv), &apos;John Landis (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Eddie Murphy (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dan Aykroyd&apos; (qv), Robert has been singled out for his ability to portray a broad range of characters.  Robert has a sterling reputation as an actor from producers, directors and audiences across the country. In his three most recent feature films, _It&apos;s Complicated (2009)_ (qv), _Halloween II (2009)_ (qv) and _The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009)_ (qv), Robert portrays three very different characters. In &quot;It&apos;s Complicated&quot;, he plays &quot;Peter&quot;, &apos;Meryl Streep&apos; (qv)&apos;s architect and friend who will introduce him to &quot;Adam&quot;, played by &apos;Steve Martin (I)&apos; (qv). This funny romantic comedy includes an all-star cast, including &apos;Alec Baldwin&apos; (qv) and &apos;John Krasinski&apos; (qv). &quot;Halloween 2&quot;, directed by &apos;Rob Zombie&apos; (qv), is a terrifying horror film in which Robert portrays the heart-wrenching father, of a murdered girl, who confronts &apos;Malcolm McDowell&apos; (qv). Robert shares the screen with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Jeff Bridges (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Kevin Spacey&apos; (qv) in &quot;The Men Who Stare At Goats&quot;, in which he portrays an Army General bent on staying ahead of the Russians!  Robert has over 120 television and film roles to his credit including: &quot;President Kennedy&quot; in _&quot;Big Love&quot; (2006)_ (qv), &quot;Warden Davis Ollenstein&quot; in _&quot;CSI: NY&quot; (2004)_ (qv), &quot;Morgan Ride&quot; in _&quot;Shark&quot; (2006)_ (qv), &quot;Miles Bainbridge&quot; in _&quot;Big Time Rush&quot; (2009)_ (qv), &quot;Dan, The Weatherman&quot; in the Showtime series, _&quot;Look&quot; (2010)_ (qv) and &quot;Vance Evans&quot; (Sharpay and Ryan&apos;s Dad) in the smash hit, &quot;High School Musical&quot; movies for Disney.  Robert&apos;s acting work has extended beyond film and television and counts himself among the lucky actors who continue to work in the theatre. His long association with the South Coast Repertory and the Pasadena Playhouse are sources of great pride and artistic expression.  Robert devotes his spare time to several charitable organizations including the &quot;Pediatric Aids Foundation&quot;, &quot;Helping Hands for the Blind&quot; and his local schools. In his spare time, he plays softball, bike rides and enjoys gardening, scuba diving and traveling.</biography>

Diane was acting from a very young age and made her stage debut at the age of six.

The film only did so-so commercially, but Olivier praised his young co-star, calling her the new &apos;Grace Kelly (I)&apos; (qv). After her well-received debut, Diane found herself on magazine covers all over the world, including &quot;Time&quot;, which declared her the &quot;new young acting sensation&quot;. However, things quietened down a bit when she found herself in such critical and financial flops as _Touched by Love (1980)_ (qv), _Cattle Annie and Little Britches (1981)_ (qv), _National Lampoon&apos;s Movie Madness (1982)_ (qv), _Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982)_ (qv) and, most unmemorably, _Six Pack (1982)_ (qv), all of which failed to set her career on fire.  She also made several TV movies during this period, but it was in 1983 that she finally began to fulfill the promise of stardom that had earlier been predicted for her. Acclaimed director &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv) took note of Diane&apos;s appeal and cast her in two &quot;youth&quot;-oriented films based on &apos;S.E. Hinton&apos; (qv) novels. Indeed, _Rumble Fish (1983)_ (qv) and _The Outsiders (1983)_ (qv) have become cult classics and resulted in her getting a loyal fan base. The industry was now taking notice of Diane Lane, and she soon secured lead roles in three big-budget studio epics. She turned down the first, _Splash (1984)_ (qv) (which was a surprise hit for &apos;Daryl Hannah&apos; (qv)). Unfortunately, the other two were critical and box-office bombs: &apos;Walter Hill (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s glossy rock &apos;n&apos; roll fable _Streets of Fire (1984)_ (qv) was not the huge summer success that many had thought it would be, and the massively troubled Coppola epic _The Cotton Club (1984)_ (qv) co-starring &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv) was also a high-profile flop. The back-to-back failure of both of these films could have ended her career there and then -- but thankfully it didn&apos;t. Possibly &quot;burned out&quot; by the lambasting these films received and unhappy with the direction her career was taking, she &quot;retired&quot; from the film business at age 19, saying that she had forgotten what she had started acting for. She stayed away from the screen for the next three years. Ironically, the two films that were the main causes of her &quot;retirement&quot; have since grown in popularity, and &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; especially seems to have found the kind of audience it couldn&apos;t get when it was first released.  The process of rebuilding her career was a slow and gradual one. First came the obscure and very sexy straight-to-video thriller _Lady Beware (1987)_ (qv), followed by the critically acclaimed but little seen _The Big Town (1987)_ (qv) with &apos;Matt Dillon (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Tommy Lee Jones&apos; (qv). In the former, Diane plays a very mysterious and sexy stripper and her memorable strip sequence is a highlight of the film. Despite her sexy new on-screen image, it wasn&apos;t until 1989&apos;s smash hit TV mini-series _&quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; (1989)_ (qv) that Diane made another big impression on a sizable audience. Her performance in the hugely popular and critically acclaimed western epic as a vulnerable &quot;whore with a heart&quot; won her an Emmy nomination and much praise. Film producers were interested in her again. Another well-received TV production, _Descending Angel (1990) (TV)_ (qv), was followed by smaller roles in major films like &apos;Richard Attenborough&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Chaplin (1992)_ (qv) and Mike Binder&apos;s _Indian Summer (1993)_ (qv), and larger parts in small independent films like _My New Gun (1992)_ (qv), _Vital Signs (1990)_ (qv) and _Knight Moves (1992)_ (qv). Indeed, the latter two films co-starred her then-husband, &apos;Christopher Lambert (I)&apos; (qv), with whom she had a daughter named Eleanor.  Diane was now re-established in Hollywood and started to appear in higher-profile co-starring roles in some big-budget, major movies like &apos;Walter Hill (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Wild Bill (1995)_ (qv), the &apos;Sylvester Stallone&apos; (qv) actioner _Judge Dredd (1995)_ (qv), the &apos;Robin Williams (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s comedy _Jack (1996)_ (qv) and _Murder at 1600 (1997)_ (qv) co-starring &apos;Wesley Snipes&apos; (qv). However, all of these still did not quite make Diane a &quot;big-name star&quot; and, by 1997, she found herself, possibly by choice, back in smaller, personal projects.  Her next role as a frustrated 1960s housewife in the independent hit _A Walk on the Moon (1999)_ (qv) deservedly won her rave notices and, at last, gave her career the big lift it needed. The cute but tear-jerking comedy _My Dog Skip (2000)_ (qv) also proved to be a small-scale success. However, it was the £330-million worldwide grossing blockbuster hit _The Perfect Storm (2000)_ (qv) that finally made Diane Lane the household name that she always should have been.  After the worldwide success of &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, she was more in demand than ever. She played &apos;Leelee Sobieski&apos; (qv)&apos;s sinister junkie guardian in the slick thriller _The Glass House (2001)_ (qv), and co-starred with &apos;Keanu Reeves&apos; (qv) in the #1 smash hit _Hard Ball (2001)_ (qv). However, her greatest career moment was still to come with her lead role in the enormous critical and commercial hit _Unfaithful (2002)_ (qv), in which she superbly portrayed &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv)&apos;s adulterous wife. Her performance won the respect of critics and audiences alike.  She is very well regarded within the industry, adored by film fans, and has a credibility and quality that is all too rare today. Her immense talent at playing human and real characters, her &quot;drop dead gorgeous&quot; beauty and down-to-earth grittiness guarantees that she will stay on top, and she guarantee has already shown the kind of resilience that will keep her working for a long, long time.</biography>

      <biography>Zach Hanner was born in Mt. Airy, North Carolina, in June of 1969 and spent his formative years growing up in nearby Pilot Mountain. After attending the North Carolina Shakespeare Festival in High Point (which featured a young Terrance Mann as Oberon in &quot;A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream&quot;), he knew that the stage would be a lifelong passion. At the age of 10, he landed the lead role in the Christmas opera &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot; and, soon after, portrayed the role of Dill in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird,&quot; both shows staged at the Andy Griffith Playhouse in Mt. Airy, Griffith&apos;s hometown.  Hanner also developed a love for music, taking piano lessons, playing drums in the school band and studying voice for many years, eventually earning a spot in the esteemed choral ensemble at the North Carolina Governor&apos;s School in 1985. Having eschewed the stage for the basketball court throughout high school, he rediscovered his love for performing while attending the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. He threw himself in to theater headlong, studying with amazing professors Paul Ferguson and Randall Hill in UNC&apos;s Performance Studies department, eventually receiving his Bachelor&apos;s degree.  Following graduation, Hanner moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, in lieu of his original desired destination, Los Angeles. Wilmington proved to be a fantastic training ground for a young actor and Hanner found many like-minded friends among the town&apos;s theater community, landing roles such as Chicklet in &quot;Psycho Beach Party,&quot; The King of Siam in &quot;The King and I,&quot; Guildenstern in &quot;Rosencratz and Guildenstern Are Dead,&quot; and dozens more. He became a founding member of The Comically Impaired, an improv comedy troupe that became a Wilmington stage staple.  He also began working in the region&apos;s burgeoning film industry, landing his first film role in &quot;Forrest Gump.&quot; Originally cast as one of the teens that chase Forrest down in a pickup truck in the infamous &quot;Run, Forrest, run!&quot; scene, Hanner&apos;s part was cut after only one day on the set. However, two weeks later he was called back to take a one-line part as a military recruit and spent four days shooting with Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks in Beaufort, South Carolina. Though his line was cut from the final version of the film, Hanner was captivated by the machinations of the film set and knew that he would always be involved in show business.  After four years and dozens of film, television and commercials jobs, Hanner struck out for New York City, studying with filmmaker Deborah Kampmeier at Michael Howard studios and performing in off Broadway productions as well as with improv comedy troupe Post No Bills. His time in New York was very productive and inspirational but living in an expensive shoebox soon lost its luster and Hanner returned to North Carolina where he assumed the role of Music, Movies and Sports Editor for triangle.citysearch.com. Shortly after, he returned to Wilmington to be near the ocean and save on the gas money he was constantly burning up to satisfy his passion for surfing.  Back in Wilmington, Hanner continued to act in theatrical and film productions, most notably portraying country music legend Hank Williams in the play, &quot;Hank Williams: Lost Highway.&quot; He also returned to music, teaching himself the ukulele and forming Da Howlies Hawaiian band. He added bass guitar, and banjo to his repertoire and, along with Da Howlies&apos; bassist Seth Moody, formed The NoSeRidErS, a retro instrumental surf music act.  With nearly 20 years in the entertainment industry, Hanner has written, produced, directed and starred in hundreds of commercials for his former employer, Advanced Metal Roofing and continues to pursue show business with the same passion that Shakespeare lit within him decades ago.</biography>

      <birthName>McMillan, Anthony Robert</birthName>
      <biography>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain&apos;s most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad&apos;s books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from &quot;Henry V&quot;. At that time he was fascinated with &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) and &apos;Orson Welles&apos; (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh&apos;s Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled &quot;Young Mental Health&quot;, which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh&apos;s renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as &quot;Border Guard&quot; in BBC&apos;s mini-series _&quot;The Lost Tribe&quot; (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director &apos;Amos Poe&apos; (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _&quot;Alfresco&quot; (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane&apos;s barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _&quot;Cracker&quot; (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by &apos;J.K. Rowling&apos; (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the &apos;Harry Potter&apos; films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, &quot;Coltrane in a Cadillac&quot;, and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _&quot;Coltrane in a Cadillac&quot; (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biography>

      <biography>At 6 years old Robert wanted to be a stuntman. By age 13, he found himself dreaming of being a director. At age 15, his passion had turned to special effects make-up. Then as the fates would have it, a high school drama teacher at Sir Winston Churchill High School forced Robert to play Barnaby Tucker in Thorton Wilder&apos;s The Matchmaker in the school&apos;s lunch-box theatre.  He never forgot that magical day, and although he took a few detours along the way, trying in vain to resist the call, the sheer thrill of moving that audience into fits of laughter-and the awakening of a previously-undiscovered vitality within him-became a major driving force in Robert&apos;s life.  He traveled around the world for a year and a half at the ripe old age of 21, and returned to his native Calgary enlightened-and at the same time daunted by the uncharted road ahead, a depressing winter on the prairies, and a family in shambles.  Restaurant jobs provided the illusion of fun and the necessary quantities of alcohol to keep Robert numb and lost, but one bright spot came in the form of an amateur theatre company named Aurora Productions. Artistic Director Peter Spear cast Robert in Bent by Martin Sherman, and in Orphans by Lyle Kessler, experiences that taught Robert that the calling was real and he&apos;d better take heed.  Finally, at age 26, Robert was accepted to Studio 58, the Theatre Arts program at Langara College in Vancouver, and he began his training. Thanks to the unparalleled patience and dedication of the teaching staff, Robert graduated and began his professional acting career at the tender age of 30.  Since then, Robert has worked with some of the best in the business. Known for his impressive range and honesty, Robert continually brings a passion and a vulnerability to his portrayals that has gained him the respect of his peers and the admiration of audiences, whether on stage or in front of the camera.  Blessed to live in Vancouver, Canada, Robert is an avid outdoor enthusiast and environmentalist. When he&apos;s not acting he can be found at the climbing gym, on the ski slopes, at the tennis courts, or supporting humanitarian or environmental causes.</biography>

      <biography>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series _&quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv), paired Johnson with the equally cool &apos;Philip Michael Thomas&apos; (qv) as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of &apos;Edward James Olmos&apos; (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named &quot;St. Vitus&apos; Dance&quot; with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world&apos;s favorite cop. For his work on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.  Johnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled; the names of his first two wives have never been made public. &apos;Tippi Hedren&apos; (qv), Johnson&apos;s co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her daughter &apos;Melanie Griffith&apos; (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s he lived with actress &apos;Patti D&apos;Arbanville&apos; (qv) and they had one son together. He remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for &apos;Antonio Banderas&apos; (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have three children together.  Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the &apos;William Faulkner (I)&apos; (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with &apos;Susan Sarandon&apos; (qv). After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like &apos;John Frankenheimer&apos; (qv), &apos;Sidney Lumet&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dennis Hopper&apos; (qv).  After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _&quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred &apos;Cheech Marin&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jodi Lyn O&apos;Keefe&apos; (qv). Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD&apos;s Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama _&quot;Just Legal&quot; (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by &apos;Jerry Bruckheimer&apos; (qv), and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange flate ballær II (2008)_ (qv) and the Italian films _Bastardi (2008)_ (qv) and _Torno a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in Rome (2010)_ (qv) with &apos;Anjelica Huston&apos; (qv) and &apos;Danny DeVito&apos; (qv), as well as the indie comedy _A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011)_ (qv). &apos;Don Johnson (I)&apos; starred in the 2007 feature film, _&quot;Moondance Alexander&quot; (2007)_, along with &apos;Lori Loughlin&apos; (qv), &apos;Kay Panabaker&apos; (qv), &apos;James Best (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Sasha Cohen (I)&apos; (qv), and &apos;Whitney Sloan&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Catherine Zeta-Jones was born on September 25, 1969 in Swansea, West Glamorgan, Wales, UK, the daughter of Dai Jones, who formerly owned a candy factory, and Pat Jones. Her brother David Jones (b. 1967) is a development executive and brother Lyndon Jones (b. 1972) works at her production company. Catherine showed an interest early on in entertainment. She starred on stage in &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. At age 15, she had the lead in the British revival of &quot;42nd Street&quot;. She was originally cast as the second understudy for the lead role in the musical but when the star and first understudy became sick the night the play&apos;s producer was in the audience, she was given the lead for the rest of the musical&apos;s production. She first made a name for herself in the early 1990s when she starred in the Yorkshire Television comedy/drama series _&quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991)_ (qv). The series was a smash hit and made her one of the United Kingdom&apos;s most popular television actresses. She subsequently played supporting roles in several films including _Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992)_ (qv), the miniseries _Catherine the Great (1996) (TV)_ (qv) and a larger part as the seductive Sala in _The Phantom (1996)_ (qv) before landing her breakthrough role playing the fiery Elena opposite &apos;Anthony Hopkins (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Antonio Banderas&apos; (qv) in _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv). She starred in many big-budget blockbusters like _Entrapment (1999)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv), for which many believed she was robbed of an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. In November 2000, she married actor &apos;Michael Douglas (I)&apos; (qv). She gave birth to their son Dylan Michael in August 2000 followed by daughter, Carys, in April 2003. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours List for her accomplishments in film and television.</biography>

The film deals with the recent announcement that both greco-roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling will no longer be competing sports at the Olympic Games after 2016. There has been much controversy with the announcement as wrestling as been included since the Ancient Olympic Games. Kohler wrote the script and also plans on starring in the film. After the death of his younger brother, an aging freestyle wrestler begins an impossible task to bring home gold in his place.</biography>

      <biography>Andrew Scott grew up in Dublin, Ireland with an older and a younger sister, Sarah and Hannah. His father, Jim, worked in the Fas government employment agency, and his mother, Nora, taught art at a secondary school. Andrew attended Gonzaga, a Jesuit school for boys on the south side of Dublin. From the age of 8 he took drama classes for children on Saturdays at the Anne Kavanagh school, and then in his early twenties he helped tutor younger students. He made two commercials for Irish television, for Flahavan&apos;s Porridge and Disney/Fanta.  At 17 Andrew starred in his first professional role in the 1994 Irish drama &quot;Korea.&quot; Later that year, he matriculated into Trinity College in Dublin to begin a degree in drama, but left after six months. He went on to perform at the Abbey Theatre, the national theater of Ireland, in four plays.  In early 2000 Scott moved to London for a supporting role in &quot;Longitude,&quot; a multi-part television movie starring Michael Gambon. Scott played many roles on the stage and received two Olivier awards. In 2006, Scott made his Broadway debut in David Hare&apos;s &quot;The Vertical Hour&quot; starring with Bill Nighy and Julianne Moore. He was nominated for a Drama League award for his role.  Occasional film and television work in Britain, Ireland and America interspersed his stage career. Most notable of these was &quot;Band of Brothers,&quot; &quot;John Adams,&quot; and the television comedy series, &quot;My Life in Film.&quot;  &quot;Sherlock,&quot; a modern-day revamp of the classic stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for BBC Television proved to be a turning point in Scott&apos;s career in 2010 when he gained notice as Moriarty, the fictional detective&apos;s nemesis.  Scott starred in the play, &quot;Birdland&quot; by Simon Stephens, in the spring of 2014, where he played the role of a jaded rock star contemplating the meaning of fame. His film work stepped up considerably with roles in several important movies including 20th Century Fox&apos;s James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe starrer, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; released in 2015.</biography>

      <biography>Kurt Russell landed a part in the &apos;Elvis Presley&apos; (qv) movie, _It Happened at the World&apos;s Fair (1963)_ (qv), when he was 10 years old. In 1960, &apos;Walt Disney&apos; (qv) himself signed Russell to a 10-year contract. Once his stint as a child actor ended, he spent the early 1970s playing minor league baseball. In 1979, he gave a classic performance as &apos;Elvis Presley&apos; (qv) in &apos;John Carpenter (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s A.B.C. TV movie. He followed with roles in a string of well-received films: _Used Cars (1980)_ (qv), _Escape from New York (1981)_ (qv), _The Thing (1982)_ (qv) and _Silkwood (1983)_ (qv). In 1983, he became reacquainted with &apos;Goldie Hawn&apos; (qv) (who appeared with him in _The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968)_ (qv)) when they worked together on _Swing Shift (1984)_ (qv). The two have lived together ever since. The movie was a failure - as was their next one together, _Overboard (1987)_ (qv). During the 1980s, Russell starred in a rash of disappointments: _The Best of Times (1986)_ (qv), _Big Trouble in Little China (1986)_ (qv) and _Winter People (1989)_ (qv). Finally, his career seemed to be seriously stalled. He only landed _Tango &amp; Cash (1989)_ (qv) after &apos;Patrick Swayze&apos; (qv) dropped out; &apos;Dennis Quaid&apos; (qv) was the first choice for the part in _Backdraft (1991)_ (qv). In the end, these two roles were the key in reestablishing him as a box-office draw. Russell and &apos;Goldie Hawn&apos; (qv) live on a 72-acre retreat, Home Run Ranch, outside of Aspen. He has two sons, &apos;Boston Russell&apos; (qv) (from a brief marriage to actress &apos;Season Hubley&apos; (qv)) and &apos;Wyatt Russell&apos; (qv) with &apos;Goldie Hawn&apos; (qv)).</biography>

      <birthName>Tamblyn, Russell Irving</birthName>
      <biography>Russ Tamblyn might as well face it...he will be a Jet &quot;till his last dying day.&quot; Indelibly linked to the &quot;womb to tomb&quot; role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), it&apos;s not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed the teenage troublemaker who became the &apos;50s equivalent of the Mercutio character in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation.  To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age ten by actor &apos;Lloyd Bridges (I)&apos; (qv) for the play &quot;Stone Jungle&quot;, Russ was soon performing on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as &quot;Rusty Tamblyn&quot; then, the tousle-haired scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_ (qv) starring another child actor, &apos;Dean Stockwell&apos; (qv). Having taken up dancing and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first TV appearance on the &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; Eventually handed a starring role in the &quot;B&quot; film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father&apos;s Little Dividend (1951)_ (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_ (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in one of MGM&apos;s best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn&apos;s timing was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with &apos;Lana Turner&apos; (qv), &apos;Arthur Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Hope Lange&apos; (qv) and &apos;Diane Varsi&apos; (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers started dwindling.  Tamblyn&apos;s last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with &apos;Julie Harris (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Claire Bloom (I)&apos; (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring &apos;Richard Widmark&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sidney Poitier&apos; (qv). After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_ (qv), _Satan&apos;s Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical &quot;Cabaret,&quot; Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn&apos;t on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990)_ (qv), it was the first time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic duties and the managing of actress/daughter &apos;Amber Tamblyn&apos; (qv)&apos;s career, she of _&quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (2003)_ (qv) fame.</biography>

      <birthName>Glenn, Theodore Scott</birthName>
      <biography>Scott Glenn was born January, 26, 1941, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As he grew up in Appalachia, his health was poor; he was bedridden for a year and doctors predicted he would limp for the rest of his life. During long periods of illness, Glenn was reading a lot and &quot;dreaming of becoming Lord Byron&quot;. He challenged his illness by intense training programs and eventually got rid of his limp.  Glenn entered William and Mary College where he majored in English. He spent three years in the Marines and then tried to combine his passion for storytelling with his passion for adventures by working for five months as a criminal reporter at the Kenosha Evening News. Glenn planned to become an author but found out he had &quot;problems with dialogs&quot;, so he decided to overcome it by studying acting. In 1966, he headed to New York where he joined George Morrison acting class. He helped in directing student plays to pay for his studies and appeared onstage in La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club productions. Soon after arriving in New York, Glenn became a fan of martial arts. In 1968, he joined The Actors Studio and began working in professional theater and TV. In 1970, &apos;James Bridges (I)&apos; (qv) offered him his first movie work in _The Baby Maker (1970)_ (qv).  Glenn left for L.A., where he spent seven of the &quot;most miserable years of [his] life&quot;. He couldn&apos;t find interesting film roles and, doing brief TV stints, he felt &quot;like a person who had to paint the Sistine Chapel with a house-painter&apos;s brush&quot;. On a brighter side, he worked episodically with &apos;Jonathan Demme&apos; (qv) (_Angels Hard as They Come (1971)_ (qv), _Fighting Mad (1976)_ (qv)), &apos;Robert Altman (I)&apos; (qv) (_Nashville (1975)_ (qv)) and &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv) (_Apocalypse Now (1979)_ (qv)). In 1978, Glenn got tired of Hollywood and moved his family to Ketchum, Idaho, where he worked as a barman, huntsman and mountain ranger for two years (occasionally acting in Seattle stage productions). James Bridges once more changed the course of Glenn&apos;s life in 1980 when he offered him the role of &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s rival in _Urban Cowboy (1980)_ (qv) and made him a star. Glenn&apos;s acting abilities and physical presence helped him to excel both in action (_Silverado (1985)_ (qv), _The Challenge (1982)_ (qv)) and drama (_The Right Stuff (1983)_ (qv), _Countdown to Looking Glass (1984) (TV)_ (qv), _The River (1984)_ (qv)) as he alternately played good guys and bad guys.  In the beginning of the &apos;90s, his career was at its peak - he appeared in such indisputable masterpieces as _The Silence of the Lambs (1991)_ (qv), and _The Hunt for Red October (1990)_ (qv). Established as one of Hollywood&apos;s most solid and respected character actors he has appeared in a wide variety of films, such as the black Freudian farce _Reckless (1995)_ (qv), the tragicomedy _Edie &amp; Pen (1996)_ (qv) and &apos;Ken Loach&apos; (qv)&apos;s socio-political declaration _Carla&apos;s Song (1996)_ (qv), alternating mainstream (_Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv), _Absolute Power (1997)_ (qv)) with independent projects (_Lesser Prophets (1997)_ (qv) and _Larga distancia (1998)_ (qv)), written by his daughter &apos;Dakota Glenn&apos; (qv)), and TV (_Naked City: A Killer Christmas (1998) (TV)_ (qv)). Continuing into the 21st century, Glenn has also appeared in _Training Day (2001)_ (qv), _W. (2008/I)_ (qv) (as &apos;Donald Rumsfeld&apos; (qv)), _Secretariat (2010)_ (qv), _Sucker Punch (2011)_ (qv), _The Paperboy (2012)_ (qv), and two of the Bourne films: _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Legacy (2012)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Paul Greengrass started his filmmaking career with a super 8 camera he found in his art room in secondary school. Those short movies were animation horror films he made using old dolls, artist dummies, and the general art room clutter.  After studying in Cambridge University he got into Granada Television School and spent the first ten years of his career roving global hot spots for the hard-hitting documentary series, World in Action. By this time he became very interested in the Northern Ireland conflict.  In 1989, he directed his first fiction movie, &quot;Resurrected&quot;, that won an award in Berlin. He continued his career as a fiction filmmaker with a serial of TV movies dealing with social and political issues: Open Fire (a police scandal about a policeman accused of murder), The One that got away (about a military operation during the first Gulf War).  His documentary style became more dynamic and intense with each movie. In 2002, Bloody Sunday achieved international acclamation and won the first prize in the Berlin Festival. After that he has continued his career in the United States with &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; starring Matt Damon.</biography>

      <biography>James is a rugged, intense character player with leading man good looks. Having first gained recognition in 1979 as &apos;Ajax&apos; (qv), in his second film, _The Warriors (1979)_ (qv). That same year he garnered acclaim on Broadway with &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv) in the concentration camp drama &quot;Bent&quot;.  In a career spanning nearly four decades, James has run the gamut of roles and solid career choices. Ranging from the psychopaths, &apos;Dutch Schultz&apos; (qv) in &apos;Francis Copolla&apos;&apos;s _The Cotton Club (1984)_ (qv) and &apos;Albert Ganz&apos; in Walter Hill&apos;s _48 Hrs. (1982)_ (qv) to Samantha&apos;s lover, the billionaire playboy, Richard Wright, in the HBO series _&quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1998)_ (qv).&quot; James has also garnered roles which highlight a more vulnerable side, such as his guitarist who gets a break in the Oscar-winning short, _Session Man (1991) (TV)_ (qv) or his artist who falls in love with a gargoyle come to life in the best segment of the horror anthology, _Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990)_ (qv) and as Mary Louise Parker&apos;s lover in Boys on the Side.  More recently James starred along side Michael C. Hall in the hit Showtime series _&quot;Dexter&quot; (2006)_ (qv) where he played Dexter&apos;s wise, compassionate, adoptive father, Harry Morgan. Grey&apos;s Anatomy fans have recently enjoyed seeing James as Karev&apos;s long-lost Dad. While remaining active with top feature films James enjoys the distinction of being the only actor to die twice, as two different characters in Quentin Tarintino&apos;s smash hit Django Unchained.  James won the 8th annual SAG award as a member of the Outstanding Comedy Ensemble for his work in Sex and the City. As a member of the ensemble cast of Dexter, James has been nominated for the SAG award and the Emmy. In recognition for his work in Sci-Fi Fantasy and Horror James was honored with the Saturn Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.</biography>

      <biography>Robert Douglas Purcell grew up in the small town of Scituate, which is located on the south shore of Massachusetts. He had a talent for art in school, graduated early from Scituate High School&apos;s Class of 1976 and joined the Marines. He has lived in California since 1982, was married in 1985 and divorced in 2003. He has two beautiful daughters.  Purcell has worked steadily in film, television and commercials. Stage credits include performances as &quot;Major Roberts&quot; in Layon Gray&apos;s acclaimed WWII play, Black Angels Over Tuskegee (2009), &quot;Murray&quot; in the New Voices/OC Playwrights Alliance production of Christmas In Pakistan (2007), &quot;Bobby&quot; in the Dillstar West production of The Soprano&apos;s Last Supper, and &quot;Petruchio&quot; in the Newport Beach Repertory production of The Haunting of Will Shakespeare. Although often cast as the authority figure, such as the &quot;Police Officer&quot; in the short film, The Silent (2006), the villainous Army General &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in the award winning short, Cassandra (2006) or the &quot;Slot Machine Pit Boss&quot; opposite Al Pacino in Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007), Purcell lists some of the more off-beat characters he has played as personal favorites. They include the down and out ex-boxer, ex-mafia tough guy &quot;Joe&quot; in the faith-based feature film, Faith Happens (2005) and the gay &quot;Bartender&quot; in the feature film, Hollywood, Je T&apos;aime (2009).  Purcell can be seen as the Angels Pitching Coach, the Umpire and annoying Sports Writer in several television commercials for Howard&apos;s TV &amp; Appliances, featuring Angels manager, Mike Scioscia and 2nd baseman, Howie Kendrick. His voice (as various characters) can be heard in several humorous Howard&apos;s TV &quot;Halo Hotline&quot; radio spots during the L.A. Angels of Anaheim &apos;07-&apos;09 baseball seasons.</biography>

      <birthName>Chu-Kheng, Yeoh</birthName>
      <biography>Born as Yang Zi Chong in the mining town of Ipoh in West Malaysia in the lunar year of the Tiger, she spoke English and Malay before Chinese. A ballet dancer since age 4, she moved to London, England to study at the Royal Academy as a teenager. After a brief dance career, she won the Miss Malaysia beauty pageant title in her native country and the Miss Moomba beauty pageant title in Melbourne, Australia in the early 1980s. Her first on camera work was a 1984 commercial with martial arts star &apos;Jackie Chan (I)&apos; (qv). In 1985, she began making action movies with D&amp;B Films of Hong Kong. She was first billed as Michelle Khan, then later, Michelle Yeoh. Never a trained martial artist, she relied on her dance discipline and her on-set trainers to prepare for her martial arts action scenes.  She uses many dance moves in her films. She still does most of her own stunts and has been injured many times. Ironically, she still cannot read Chinese and she has to have Chinese script read to her.

      <biography>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival, by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D&apos;Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner &apos;Roger Avary&apos; (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with friends and fellow auteurs &apos;Alexandre Rockwell&apos; (qv), &apos;Robert Rodriguez (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Allison Anders&apos; (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino&apos;s next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv). The film did fairly well theatrically.</biography>

      <biography>Ryan S. Staséll is an American writer and actor. He was born in Winfield, Illinois in 1991. He grew up in the suburbs of Chicago with his parents, two sisters, and older brother. In the summer of 2006, he began his own production company entitled [Something Untitled] Productions, where he wrote and directed his own short films. Some of these shorts included Saint Nik, Vigilance!, Slivers, and Lakeview Everlasting. His work is heavily inspired by 80&apos;s horror, dry comedies, and literary criticism. In 2009, Ryan went on to discover his interest in acting when he was cast in Julane Sullivan&apos;s 2009 production of A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream. Helming [Something Untitled] also forced him to occasionally dabble in acting; he sometimes co-starred in shorts alongside Benjamin C. Tennant. Ryan&apos;s interest in acting peaked when he was cast as Christopher Wren in Agatha Christie&apos;s the Mousetrap and has continued acting, with a passion, ever since.</biography>

She grew up on the road with her parents and younger sister. She often performed in the children&apos;s chorus of whatever production her mother was in. That singing talent later came in handy for her role as an aspiring country singer in _The Thing Called Love (1993)_ (qv). Her family moved back to the Washington area when she was adolescent. She later enrolled in East Carolina University in North Carolina, where she studied acting. Shortly afterward she moved to New York to pursue a career on the stage. This led to acting in television programs and then feature films. She gave memorable performances in _Demolition Man (1993)_ (qv) and _Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993)_ (qv), but did not achieve the stardom that seemed inevitable for her until her work in the smash hit _Speed (1994)_ (qv). She now ranks as one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. For her role in _The Blind Side (2009)_ (qv) she won the Oscar, and her blockbusters _The Proposal (2009/I)_ (qv), _The Heat (2013/I)_ (qv) and _Gravity (2013)_ (qv) made her a bankable star. With $56,000,000, she was listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the highest-paid actress in the world.</biography>

      <birthName>Paymer, David Charles</birthName>
      <biography>One of modern TV and moviedom&apos;s most sturdy and reliable character actors, David Paymer dreamed of being an actor from early childhood. Although he came from a traditional middle-class Jewish family that urged him to become a doctor or lawyer, Paymer felt more at home in the world of the thespian. At 14, he used a fake I.D. to see The Graduate, which starred a young Dustin Hoffman. He grew up in Oceanside, New York, where his father was in the scrap metal business. His mother, a homemaker, had fled Belgium with her family to escape the Nazis. When his father quit the scrap metal business to pursue music, it inspired young Paymer to give his acting dream a try. His aborted big break came when he was cast in the TV series, St. Elsewhere, as &quot;Dr. Wayne Fiscus&quot; - then promptly dumped and replaced by Howie Mandel. Luckily, his real big break was destined to be on the big screen, as &quot;Ira Shalowitz&quot; in the Billy Crystal vehicle, City Slickers. Crystal was so pleased with Paymer&apos;s work that he wrote the part of &quot;Stan Yankelman&quot;, beleaguered brother of the titular character in the movie, Mr. Saturday Night, especially for Paymer. The part earned Paymer an Oscar nomination in 1993.  &quot;That was like getting my passport stamped&quot;, said Paymer and he was quickly in demand by directors such as Spielberg (&quot;Amistad&quot;), Redford (&quot;Quiz Show&quot;), Oliver Stone (&quot;Nixon&quot;), David Mamet (&quot;State &amp; Main&quot;), Steven Soderbergh (&quot;Ocean&apos;s 13&quot;), and Sam Raimi (&quot;Drag me to Hell&quot;). Chameleon-like in his portrayals, Paymer has since starred in hundreds of roles in film &amp; television, notably &quot;The American President&quot;, &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, &quot;Payback&quot;, &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, &quot;In Good Company&quot;, Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &quot;Twixt&quot; and Kenneth Branagh&apos;s &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow One&quot;.  Paymer received Golden Globe nominations for &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; and for HBO&apos;s &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;. Paymer became a hyphenate in 2002, directing the acclaimed comedy short &quot;Candor City Hospital&quot; for Showtime. He has since directed over 60 episodes for broadcast television, including such hits as &quot;Grey&apos;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; &amp; &quot;The Unit&quot;. He is also a producer and director on the CW series &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;. Paymer resides in Santa Monica, CA with his wife and two daughters.</biography>

      <biography>Julian Richings was born in Oxford, England, and has become a familiar figure to Canadian cinema and television audiences, appearing in over 50 films and 20 separate television series.  After training in drama at the University of Exeter and touring North America with a British stage production, Mr. Richings moved to Toronto, Canada in 1984. Within five years, he had become a regular on the second season of the Canadian _&quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (1988)_ (qv) TV series. Other roles followed, and he gained critical acclaim as the bitter, aging punk rock legend Bucky Haight in &apos;Bruce McDonald (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s mock-documentary _Hard Core Logo (1996)_ (qv). His appearance in &apos;Vincenzo Natali&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Cube (1997)_ (qv) was brief, but definitely memorable. In 2000, Mr. Richings appeared as Francis Bellanger, an itinerant railroad worker who falls in love with a prostitute (played by &apos;Shirley Henderson (I)&apos; (qv)), in _The Claim (2000)_ (qv), and the role earned him a Genie Award nomination for best supporting actor. His performance as the nearly-blind security guard Otto in &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _&quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; (2004)_ (qv) was considered especially impressive by many critics. A busy stage actor as well, Mr. Richings was presented with two Dora Awards in the late 1980s and continues to perform professionally in the Toronto area. He tends to appear in small, experimental theaters and has been known to work for free if he thinks the material is interesting enough. In addition to acting, Mr. Richings has taught seminars and classes on acting and on movement for actors in the Toronto area for nearly twenty years. Mr. Richings is married and has two children. He resides with his family in Toronto.</biography>

      <biography>Skipper Landry was born on Veterans Day, 1971 on Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska to Paul &amp; Margarita Landry. Soon after his father&apos;s enlistment was up, his family moved back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and settled down.  Medical issues kept Skipper from attending most of elementary and middle school, but he eventually was able to attended, and graduate from Calvary Christian School. During his high school years he landed his first job, a cashier at K-mart at the age of 15. In his junior year until well into college, he worked along side of friends such as Jeff, Chris, Zeke and Lyle as a DJ at local night clubs. He attended Louisiana State University for a time where he failed out due to frequenting the student union rather than classes.  Skipper eventually settled down working as a security and fire alarm technician where he worked most of his adult life and still holds an active NICET III Life Safety license.  One constant throughout his life was his need to be creative. Early on it manifested through landscaping lawns in his neighborhood, then through building, modifying, restoring and showcasing cars and motorcycles. At one point in time he bought and restored a 1982 DeLorean DMC12. Most recently his need to be creative has taken the form of acting and cinematography.  At the age of 38, he was introduced to acting by a fluke. Skipper began taking classes in acting in New Orleans and was soon showing up in bit parts in feature films. His has been in featured in major motion pictures, tv series, a few made for tv movies and just recently wrapped on an independent supernatural thriller and is filming his first co-staring SAG role in January 2013.  Moving to acting full time in 2012 has been a major step toward building a creative outlet and entertaining others by telling good stories.</biography>

      <birthName>Boring, Jeremy Davies</birthName>
      <biography>Jeremy Davies attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, California. He made his film debut starring in David O. Russell&apos;s acclaimed first film, the Indy classic, &quot;Spanking the Monkey&quot;, which became a surprise Sundance Film Festival winner, earning Jeremy an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance.  Davies&apos; portrayal of Tom Hanks&apos; interpreter, &apos;Private Upham&apos;, in Steven Spielberg&apos;s Academy Award winning film, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; also earned him considerable critical acclaim and subsequent Oscar buzz.  Davies&apos; other film credits include Steven Soderbergh&apos;s &quot;Solaris&quot;, with George Clooney and Viola Davis; &quot;Going All the Way&quot; with Ben Affleck; &quot;The Locusts&quot; with Vince Vaughn; Wim Wenders&apos; &quot;Million Dollar Hotel&quot;; Lars von Trier&apos;s acclaimed avant-garde films, &quot;Dogville&quot; and &quot;Manderlay&quot; with Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsgard; &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; with Christian Bale and Steve Zahn, and directed by the legendary Werner Herzog; &quot;Nell&quot; with Jodie Foster and Liam Neeson; &quot;Half Nelson&quot; writer/directors Ryan Fleck &amp; Anna Boden&apos;s &quot;It&apos;s Kind of a Funny Story&quot;; &quot;Guncrazy&quot; with Drew Barrymore, and Jan de Bont&apos;s &quot;Twister&quot; with Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  In television, Davies was invited to join the cast of JJ Abram&apos;s groundbreaking show, &quot;Lost&quot;, and soon after, his character, &apos;Daniel Faraday&apos;, quickly became an integral part of the &quot;Lost&quot; mythology and a favorite of critics and fans (to the extent that ABC began selling Faraday bobbleheads).  After &quot;Lost&quot;, Davies joined Timothy Olyphant, Walton Goggins and Margo Martindale on Graham Yost&apos;s acclaimed, Emmy winning FX show, &quot;Justified&quot;, based on a short story by the great Elmore Leonard. Wildly against his better judgment, Yost generously granted Jeremy unusual freedom to develop the character of Mags Bennett&apos;s middle son, and Davies&apos; subsequent ferocious and fragile Richard the Third-esque portrayal of Harlan, Kentucky outlaw &apos;Dickie Bennett&apos; was so far removed from &apos;Daniel Faraday&apos;, his work earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor.  Davies&apos; television work also includes the Emmy-honored HBO film, &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;.  Davies was raised without television, and experienced a vividly nomadic (non-military brat), low-income childhood, growing up throughout the US and abroad, including Vermont, Seattle, Oregon, Kansas, Michigan, New Orleans, Latin America, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and the Kingdom of California.</biography>

      <biography>Belinda Owino was born in Houston Texas, with a great passion for the performing arts. Belinda&apos;s earlier training began at the historic Houston HITS Theatre, The Texas Renaissance Festival, and other local facilities along with starring in many play productions. Belinda also has a voice for singing and took part in talent showcases, winning first place two years in a row. The journey has not always been easy as there were times that Belinda and her mom drove hundreds of miles and even slept overnight in their car many times in order to make it to auditions and acting opportunities. An optimistic vibe and holding on to an ambition has been the driving force behind Belinda&apos;s strive to succeed. Determination and motivation led to Belinda&apos;s major opportunity when she worked with Quentin Tarantino and his dream team of a cast and crew in &quot;Django Unchained&quot; as a house servant in Candyland Plantation and as a stunt performer in the major fight scene in 2012.</biography>

      <biography>By transforming into his characters and pulling the audience in, Ed Harris has earned the reputation as one of the most talented actors of our time. Born in Tenafly, New Jersey, Harris grew up as the middle child. After graduating high school, he attended New York&apos;s Columbia University, where he played football.

He left Columbia, headed to Oklahoma, where his parents were living, and enrolled in the University of Oklahoma&apos;s theater department. After graduation, he moved to Los Angeles to find work. He started acting in theater and television guest spots. Harris landed his first leading role in a film in cult-favorite &apos;George A. Romero (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv). Two years later, he got his first taste of critical acclaim, playing astronaut &apos;John Glenn (III)&apos; (qv) in _The Right Stuff (1983)_ (qv). Also that year, he made his New York stage debut in &apos;Sam Shepard&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Fool for Love&quot;, a performance that earned him an Obie for Outstanding Actor. Harris&apos; career gathered momentum after that. In 2000, he made his debut as a director in the Oscar-winning film _Pollock (2000)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>British classical stage and TV actor Tim Pigott-Smith is a familiar face both here and in his native England. A drama major, he graduated from the University of Bristol in 1967 (where he frequently lectures) and made his professional debut two years later with the Bristol Old Vic. Predominantly a stage player in both regional and repertory, he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; as Dr. Watson in 1974. Over the years, he has appeared opposite England&apos;s theatre royalty including Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Geraldine James, Margaret Tyzack, and Patrick Stewart. He formed his own theatre company in later years, Compass, and served as its artistic director from 1989-1992. In addition, he has directed several major productions including &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;A Royal Hunt of the Sun.&quot; He has taken several Shakespearean classics to TV, including his Hotspur in &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and Angelo in &quot;Measure for Measure,&quot; and delivered impressive performances in such prestigious mini-series productions as &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years,&quot; &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot; and &quot;The Jewel in the Crown.&quot; Lesser known for his body of film work, such movies as Aces High (1976), his film debut, Joseph Andrews (1977), Victory (1981), Clash of the Titans (1981), State of Emergency (1986), Remains of the Day (1993), and Martin Scorcese&apos;s Gangs of New York (2002) have yet given him that necessary breakout role. Tim is a frequent broadcaster who has recorded many audio books and has published the anthology, &quot;Out of India.&quot; He has long been married to actress Pamela Miles and they have one son, Tom, who is a concert solo violinist. He recently scored critical acclaim in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; (both London and Broadway), and as Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot; Most recently he graced the stage with Ms. Mirren in the 4 1/2 hour production of &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra.&quot;</biography>

      <biography>Calley was born the son of a car salesman in Jersey City, New Jersey, and attended Columbia University before briefly serving in the Army. At NBC, he started in the mail room and moved up through the ranks from from 1951-57 in a still-young TV industry, from sale and production before settling in as director of nighttime programming. Later at Henry Jaffe Enterprises, he developed and produced musical programming; soon after he served the Ted Bates Advertising Agency as its radio and TV programming VP, until 1960.  Eventually it was at Filmways, where Calley hit his stride and either developed or produced appealing fare from _Catch-22 (1970)_ (qv) to The _The Americanization of Emily (1964)_ (qv), _The Cincinnati Kid (1965)_ (qv) and _The Loved One (1965)_ (qv). When Warner Bros., merged with Filmways later in the &apos;60s, Calley was promoted to executive VP of worldwide production, later rising to president and then vice chairman, under &apos;Frank Wells (IV)&apos; (qv).  In addition to _All the President&apos;s Men (1976)_ (qv), Calley&apos;s Warner Bros. years featured hits like _Superman (1978)_ (qv), _Chariots of Fire (1981)_ (qv) and _Woodstock (1970)_ (qv). However, after falling victim to an unhappy marriage and burnout from his involvement in the making of over 120 films at Warner&apos;s, he all but dropped out of Hollywood for the next 10 years, moving away from the studio scene to pursue the life of a &quot;virtual hermit&quot; first at his huge home on Fishers&apos;s Island, New York, and then in rural Connecticut.  Eventually in the 1990s, Calley returned as one of the producers of Merchant-Ivory&apos;s _The Remains of the Day (1993)_ (qv), which led to the only Oscar nomination in his half-century career.  Also in 1993, Calley was persuaded to return to the executive suite in an effort to resurrect faded United Artists. His credit for doing so was linked to his shepherding the latest James Bond feature, big-budget _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv), as well as his decision to support the low-budget _Leaving Las Vegas (1995)_ (qv).  Ultimately, it was when he once again teamed with director &apos;Mike Nichols (I)&apos; (qv) (of &apos;Catch-22&apos; fame) that he scored his greatest triumph at UA, with _The Birdcage (1996)_ (qv), a comedy that grossed well over $100 million.  However, that same year, Calley moved on from MGM/UA to Sony Pictures Entertainment as its president and COO, where he managed to achieve another turnaround. Two years later, having met his latest challenge, he returned to producing, once again hitting the mark with Nichols&apos;s _Closer (2004/I)_ (qv), and then with the _The Da Vinci Code (2006)_ (qv) original and its&apos; sequel _Angels &amp; Demons (2009)_ (qv).  In 2009, Calley received recognition from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences when he won the &apos;Irving Thalberg&apos; (qv) Memorial Award and was celebrated as &apos;one of the most trusted and admired figures in Hollywood.  When film executive and producer John Calley died on September 13, 2011, Variety described him as a &quot;studio lion.&quot; In his 50-year career, he headed three different major movie studios and helped fashion dozens of popular as well as influential pictures, including _The Exorcist (1973)_ (qv), &apos;Catch-22,&apos; &apos;All the President&apos;s Men&apos; and &apos;The Da Vinci Code.&apos; Calley was renowned as a brilliant, almost scholarly executive, who was candid, humorous and low-key, yet his productions ran the gamut of budgets and genres.</biography>

      <biography>Born and raised in the &quot;1970&apos;s predominantly Italian&quot; Morris Park section of the North East Bronx in New York City, Bill graduated from Public School 108, St. Francis Xavier and St. Raymond&apos;s High School For Boys and attended some college (Fordham /John Jay). After working as a Wild Animal Keeper at the Catskill Game Farm (now closed due to very poor management on the part of the Founder&apos;s daughter) and an Office Manager for the late then Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, Bill followed in his Father&apos;s and Grandfather&apos;s footsteps and was sworn in as a New York City Housing Authority Police Officer in July of 1983 and spent three years on uniformed patrol in the housing projects of the South Bronx, Harlem and the Lower East Side. In 1986, with the emergence of the &quot;crack&quot; epidemic, he was assigned as an undercover narcotics officer on a re-assignment to the NYPD. In 1989, a year after his teammate (P.O.Christopher Hoban) was killed in a drug bust gone bad (unfortunately the same night another NYPD Police Officer, Michael Buczyek of the 34th Pct was killed) he was re-assigned back to the Housing Police Department where he was promoted to Detective and continued working several different assignments throughout the city. In 1995, a merge between the Housing and Transit Authority Police Departments and the NYPD sent him to the 28th Precinct Detective Squad in Harlem. Seven years and numerous assignments later including the Homicide Squad and the Special Victims Unit, Bill was transferred, at his request, to the Central Park Precinct Detective Squad in Central Park in Manhattan where he would have more &quot;down time&quot; to focus on his impending retirement and the pursuit of his second career as an actor. On October 31, 2003, Halloween Day, Bill officially retired from the NYPD, after almost 21 years. In addition to enjoying a so far successful part-time acting career, Bill also owned and operated (2003 to 2009)William H. Burns &amp; Associates Inc. a Private Investigation, Personal Protection and Armed Personal Driver Services business catering mainly to the Music and Entertainment industry. During the summer of 2007, Bill also volunteered part-time as an Animal Keeper in the Mammal Department at The Bronx Zoo. He is an avid skier, scuba diver, outdoors fanatic and wannabe chef!!!

      <birthDateAsString>26 July 1959</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Fowler, Kevin Spacey</birthName>
      <biography>As enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey has always kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, &quot;the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person&quot;.  There are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Thomas and Kathleen Fowler in South Orange, New Jersey. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. They eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister&apos;s tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played &quot;Captain von Trapp&quot; opposite classmate &apos;Mare Winningham&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Maria&quot; in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (&apos;James Stewart (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Johnny Carson (I)&apos; (qv) were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.  He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, &apos;Val Kilmer&apos; (qv)) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of &quot;Henry VI&quot;.  Festival head &apos;Joseph Papp&apos; (qv) ushered the young actor out into the &quot;real world&quot; of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in &apos;Henrik Ibsen&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;. He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in &apos;David Rabe (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, &apos;Jack Lemmon&apos; (qv), on a production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Long Day&apos;s Journey Into Night&quot;. While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as &quot;Uncle Louie&quot; in &apos;Neil Simon (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s Broadway hit &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;.  Spacey&apos;s film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in _Heartburn (1986)_ (qv). Deemed more of a &quot;character actor&quot; than a &quot;leading man&quot;, he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain &quot;Mel Profitt&quot; on the TV series _&quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1987)_ (qv). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in _Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)_ (qv), a sadistic Hollywood exec in _Swimming with Sharks (1994)_ (qv), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in _The Usual Suspects (1995)_ (qv).  The &quot;Suspects&quot; role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in &apos;David Fincher&apos; (qv)&apos;s thriller _Se7en (1995)_ (qv) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Looking for Richard (1996)_ (qv), Spacey made his own directorial debut with _Albino Alligator (1996)_ (qv), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in _L.A. Confidential (1997)_ (qv) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in _Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997)_ (qv). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban satire _American Beauty (1999)_ (qv) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences&apos; imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.  No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he&apos;s finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.  In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, _Cloaca (2003) (TV)_ (qv)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s A Moon for the Misbegotten along with &apos;Colm Meaney&apos; (qv) and &apos;Eve Best&apos; (qv), and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the &apos;David Mamet (I)&apos; (qv) 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by &apos;Jeff Goldblum&apos; (qv) and &apos;Laura Michelle Kelly&apos; (qv).  In 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, House of Cards. Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show&apos;s first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include outstanding lead actor in a drama series.</biography>

      <biography>Born and raised in Chicago and New York City, James DuMont was destined for television; his great Uncle Alan B. DuMont created the DuMont Television Network of the &apos;40&apos;s and &apos;50&apos;s, which featured Jackie Gleason in &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, filmed on DuMont television cameras and broadcast in homes on DuMont TVs. James began his career in Chicago as a child model as the 1966 Gerber Baby. Modeling led to television commercials for McDonald&apos;s and Sears and professional theatre where he performed in &quot;Peter Pan &amp; Oliver Twist&quot;. At the age of 10, James was paid to DJ at Dingbat&apos;s Disco in Chicago, where the local bouncer was Mr. T and his DJ mentor was none other than the originator of House Music DJ Larry Levan. This eventually led to his DJing at the famed Studio 54 in NYC and then to his performing with the Joffrey Ballet starring Rudolph Nureyev. DuMont got his SAG card by dancing in the street to Ray Charles in &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot; He then booked his first speaking role in the classic 80&apos;s film &quot;Class&quot; with Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy. James attended Whitney Young High School with the future First Lady Michelle Obama and was in the 100th graduating class of Evanston Township High School, known for it&apos;s actor alumni, which includes John &amp; Joan Cusack and Jeremy Piven.

This earned James rave reviews. James then decided to &apos;go nude&apos; once more in the National Tour of &quot;Six Degrees.&quot;  When that tour ended, James moved to Los Angeles, where he helped create EST-The LA Project (EST/LA), producing and developing over 200 plays. EST/LA performed at the US Comedy Arts Fest in Aspen where the company won the &apos;Best of the Fest&apos; Award. During this time, DuMont worked on such TV series as &quot;The George Carlin Show&quot; and recurred as Ralph (the tabloid reporter) on &quot;Lois &amp; Clark.&quot; He also appeared in such memorable Films as: &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T&quot;, &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; , &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; and &quot;Ocean&apos;s 13.&quot;  Leading roles in Showtime&apos;s &quot;Enemies Among Us&quot; and &quot;The Cellar Door&quot; (which James co-produced and won the &apos;Best Actor&apos; award as well as &apos;Best Feature&apos;Award at &apos;Shreikfest&apos; in Hollywood) soon followed. James also produced &quot;The Confession&quot;, winning 20 of 25 international film festivals, with Michael Moore (&quot;Bowling For Columbine&quot;) calling it &quot;One of the darkest, funniest shorts I have ever seen.&quot; James co-produced the Feature Film &quot;Statistics&quot;, which won the Audience Award at the Silverlake Film Festival, produced and starred in the critically acclaimed Theatre productions of &quot;Serious Games&quot; &amp; &quot;Morphic Resonance&quot; which won both the LA Weekly Award for Best Ensemble and the Los Angeles Times &apos;Critic&apos;s Choice Award&apos;.  James DuMont has recurred on two critically acclaimed Television series: HBO&apos;s &quot;Treme&quot; (opposite Oscar winning actress Melissa Leo) and TNT&apos;s &quot;Men Of A Certain Age&quot; (opposite 4-time Emmy winning actor Ray Romano). James has four upcoming Feature Films: &quot;Barefoot&quot; with Evan Rachel Wood &amp; Scott Speedman, &quot;Baytown Outlaws&quot; with Billy Bob Thornton, &quot;Universal Soldier - A New Dimenson&quot; with Scott Adkins and &quot;Rock Jocks&quot; with Andrew Bowen (Mad TV). Recent TV Credits include Mad Men, Harry&apos;s Law &amp; Rizzoli &amp; Isles.  With over 95 major Feature Films and Television Shows and over 20 National commercials under his belt, James&apos; career is showing no signs of slowing down.

      <biography>Shae Wilson had just entered her freshman year in high school the day she watched a Charlie&apos;s Angels&apos; episode and her future was set: she was determined to play the fourth angel. The next morning she tracked down the school drama teacher and gave her no choice but to get her in a drama class. Thus began her career as an actor.  It wasn&apos;t Charlie&apos;s Angels that launched her acting career, it was playing the heroine. She beat out over 10,000 actors who came to Las Vegas to compete for Star Trek The Experience roles. For the next seven years she bravely battled aliens as an officer on the Starship Enterprise. Her ability to save the human race was so impressive, it landed her a lead in the sci-fi feature, War of the Planets.  Shae is much more than an alien fighter. She has continued to grow in diversity through study and challenging roles in TV, film, theater, and commercials. For example in Ocean&apos;s 13, she played the soft spoken ticket agent alongside a star studded cast. Her portrayal of an harassed cocktail waitress on America&apos;s Most Wanted was so moving,, it led to the capture of an at-large criminal. She won the hearts of audiences and critics as Toby in the stage production of Niel Simon&apos;s&quot;The Gingerbread Lady.&quot; Her charisma and naturalness in front of the camera have landed her with many commercials.  Her lifelong passion for creating characters and performing spills over into improv. As an understudy with the world-famous Second City Comedy Troupe, her kooky-and convincing--characters kept audiences rolling in the aisles.  Shae compliments her acting as a talented singer and dancer, which makes her a triple treat. She has wowed audiences around the country as Florence Ballard in an ensemble that impersonates the Supremes and placed first in several hip hop dance contests!  Shae gives back by sharing her gift in nonpaying productions. Most recently she played a woman twice her age in &quot;The Party&quot; at a retirement center. During the meet and greet, residents were shocked to learn that she wasn&apos;t one of them.  Shae expresses equally intense passion and dedication in her biggest roles of all-mother, daughter, sister and friend. She is grateful for the love and support of those around her who constantly reminder that no matter how tough the business gets, &quot;Nobody puts baby in a corner.&quot;</biography>

      <birthName>Bonaventura, Anthony Paul</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Chicago and raised in Northwest Indiana, Tony&apos;s childhood was a far cry from the nurturing and stable environment in which all children should be raised. Taken away by DCFS from his biological parents at age 2 due to substance abuse, Tony and his older brother lived with their biological aunt for a short period before being taken away yet again. Tony and his brother were placed in several different foster homes before finally being adopted by Dr. Angelo and Kathy Bonaventura at the age of 9. But, as normal as Tony thought his life was, he still had his ups and downs. Tony&apos;s parents divorced when he was 13. Growing up, Tony found himself getting into trouble at school and with the law. He was kicked out of several different high schools; once at St. John&apos;s Military Academy for escaping in the trunk of a friends car. Tony also attended Valparaiso High School but was kicked out his senior year. During this tough time, Tony was incarcerated and finally got his GED. On November 4th, 1997 Tony&apos;s father, whom he was very close to, died of cancer. Although Tony&apos;s life was characterized by instability, one thing remained constant; he wanted to act. At age 21, Tony became the father to a beautiful baby girl named Michela. It was at this point he knew he had to focus on achieving his goals, and that meant making changes. Tony left Indiana and moved to Chicago when he was 23 hoping to get started on his acting career. Tony enrolled at Columbia College for two years majoring in Film and also took acting classes at the Audition Studio. He worked on several low budget films including The Guys (2004), which premiered at the Music Box at the Chicago Comedy Film Festival and I Was A Mathlete Until I Met Margo Marris (2003), which premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival, Tribeca, Newport Beach, Dances with Films (Santa Monica, CA), and the Sidewalk Moving Film Festival. When Tony wasn&apos;t working on films he did some theater work at Navy Pier, one of Chicago&apos;s biggest tourist attractions. In This Town, Tony plays the role of Jimmy, a young man who has a one night stand with his adolescence alongside his childhood friends.</biography>

During his years at Cours Florent, he also started his professional career in the plays De Gaulle, the man who said no and Jesus, the rebirth directed by Robert Hossein. He also made an appearance in an episode of Ab fab shot in Paris. Xavier continued to train for acting in the Jack Waltzer workshop, member of the Actors Studio NY. He then played the role of Max in Arthur Shnitzler&apos;s play Anatole, directed by Fabrice Adrien. After these experiences, for more than two years, he joined the TV series School of life (La Vie Devant Nous) in which he played the role of Mathias Granier. In 2002, he wrote a personal project called Sumoto life, a short movie in which he played with Jean-Claude Dreyfus, Claire Nebout and Gilles Detroit.

      <biography>Teri Lynn Hatcher was born in Palo Alto, California, USA, as the only child of Owen and Esther Hatcher, and grew up in nearby Sunnyvale, California. Her father is a nuclear physicist and her mother is a computer programmer. She spent her childhood dancing and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team that had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large headdresses they wore. She was voted &quot;Most Likely to Become a _&quot;Solid Gold&quot; (1980)_ (qv) Dancer&quot; by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers.  Hatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series _&quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977)_ (qv). She went on to play &quot;Penny Parker,&quot; a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress on _&quot;MacGyver&quot; (1985)_ (qv). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy &quot;Lois Lane&quot; on _&quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993)_ (qv), saying that she didn&apos;t want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as &quot;Penny Parker.&quot;  She married actor &apos;Jon Tenney&apos; (qv) in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter &apos;Emerson Tenney&apos; (qv) on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play &quot;Sally Bowles&quot; in a road tour of Cabaret. The tour debuted in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly comedic soap opera _&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004)_ (qv), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega-hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, &quot;Susan Mayer,&quot; was consistently named as America&apos;s favorite &quot;Desperate Housewife.&quot; Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG Award for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show&apos;s first season was even over.</biography>

      <biography>Gregory Allen Gabroy grew up in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania and during his formative years attended the prestigious Haverford School. It became apparent early on that Gregory had a gift for public performance, winning several public speaking awards and being featured on stage as an actor as well as singer. During his tenure, he also appeared in several independent films including Ice Scream, The Ten Commitments and the critically acclaimed Ace of Hearts. After graduating with honors, he went on to attend Tulane University. During his time in New Orleans he received instruction from Ashley Nolan and while abroad in Spain went under the tutelage of R. Domenech. Upon his return to America, he was asked to model for a alcohol awareness campaign and offered his voice talent as a public service announcer to WTUL 91.5 FM. Graduating cum laude with a double major in History and Spanish, he left New Orleans just a few months before Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. His return to the Philadelphia area after graduating college allowed him to hone his acting skills by taking several classes with Mike Lemon and participating in several more independent films. After taking stock and with his family&apos;s blessing, Gregory packed two suitcases and bought a one way ticket to Los Angeles. He has never looked back.</biography>

      <biography>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular radio disc jockey on Chicago&apos;s number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment instead.  While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970&apos;s based major motion picture, &quot;American Gangster.&quot; Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time, Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70&apos;s style afro and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson&apos;s eyes and the hairstyle befitting of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, &quot;Common Sense.&quot;  With the successful major motion picture, &quot;American Gangster&quot; under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was &quot;Django Unchained,&quot; and the role was that of the character named, &quot;Blueberry,&quot; a slave turned killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861. &quot;Django Unchained&quot; went on the be Mr. Tarantino&apos;s highest grossing film to date.

      <birthName>Craig, Daniel Wroughton</birthName>
      <biography>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre&apos;s most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as &quot;James Bond&quot; in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).  He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of &quot;Ring O&apos; Bells&quot; pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in &quot;Oliver&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre&apos;s (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director &apos;Edward Wilson (I)&apos; (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside &apos;Ewan McGregor&apos; (qv) and &apos;Alistair McGowan&apos; (qv), then later &apos;Damian Lewis (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Joseph Fiennes&apos; (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of &apos;Colin McCormack (I)&apos; (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named &apos;Ella Craig&apos; (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray &quot;James Bond&quot;, in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with &apos;Eric Bana&apos; (qv) under the directorship of &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv).  Craig&apos;s reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool &quot;007&quot;. He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv), &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Timothy Dalton&apos; (qv) and &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as &quot;Bond&quot;.</biography>

      </akaNames>
      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Raised in the South of France, the only child Philippe Durand started his career with the Alphabet Theater, a reputable independent theater company in Nice, in the play entitled &quot;Dieu aboie-t-il?&quot; by Francois Boyer. Encouraged by the reviews, Philippe pursued acting, mostly stage, playing the leading men in &quot;The School Of Wives&quot;, &quot;Don Juan&quot; and &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; among others. Philippe&apos;s father was a wonderful singer and his mother was a ballerina at a very young age. After the war, Philippe&apos;s parents decided to live a different professional life. Nevertheless when Philippe was born, the artistic vibes were already there. Philippe got his first theatrical roles with the studio Of the Victorine: &quot;Ombres&quot;, &quot;Heidi&quot;, an appearance in &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; with Michael Caine and Steve Martin, and &quot;Monte-Carlo&quot; with Joan Collins. But it was on stage, at the National Theater of Nice directed at the time by Jacques Weber, that Philippe caught the attention of the producers and agents with the lead role of the tormented and versatile soldier in love, Woyzeck, in &quot;Woyzeck&quot; by Georg Buchner. Philippe won a critic Award for the role (1994). Philippe is also a singer-songwriter and at a very young age played piano at the well-known Conservatory of Nice He won many prizes from age 5 to 18 before starting an acting career a few years later. Philippe began competing in sports at an earlty age as well and is an accomplished athlete. He won competitions in skiing, swimming, tennis, and soccer. Since said competitions Philippe has continued to practice sports on a regular basis.  It was in Paris that Philippe started to write and to direct while pursuing his acting career. With four shorts (two award-winning in European festivals), three full scripts and his credits as an actor under his belt, Philippe arrived in Los Angeles. He bought an old American car at first and was working hard to smoothe his accent. Being stuck in LA traffic was helpful for Philippe. He practiced constantly that way. He soon appeared in a series of guest-starring roles in &quot;USA High&quot; (1998), &quot;Seven Stages&quot;, the co-lead in the independent film &quot;Pinter&quot;, and the lead in another independent film &quot;The Islander&quot;. He then booked a guest-starring role in the Emmy Award-winning show, &quot;Frasier&quot; (2001), played the role of a mean French lover in the feature film &quot;Not Entirely Awake&quot; (2002), booked the co-lead in the French-English-Italian feature &quot;Two Lonely Friends&quot; (2003), and a challenging co-starring role in &quot;American Dreams&quot; (2004), playing the French Mercenaire, Rene, who gives JJ (played by Will Estes) a hard time. He also played on stage the role of Valmont in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; by Laclos. Philippe has been seen in a feature film with Christopher Walken entitled &quot;Balls of Fury&quot;(Focus Pictures/Universal)(2007). He went to Brazil to play the role of the race car pilot Symington in &quot;Bluecross&quot;. He played on stage Jean-Pierre, the French lover of an American girl named Emma, in a love triangle story entitled &quot;The Innocent Love of a Butterfly&quot;. This play was originally a screenplay that will be soon made into a feature film. He passed successfully his first audition at the Actors Studio with a scene from Fool For Love by Sam Sheppard, playing the role of Eddie, a cowboy. For a Frenchman, that was already an accomplishment. Something that will help him later on. Meanwhile Philippe has been pursuing his writing and directing career in the US and in Europe. Philippe&apos;s first American movie as a writer-director, &quot;Black and Blue&quot;(2005-2006), was a touching story about missing children. &quot;Black and Blue&quot; received acclaims from associations for the missing children. In 2008 he was approached to be part of an epic story about love and racism with an American cast. Philippe&apos;s other focus has been a compelling love story drama entitled &quot;The Innocent Love of a Butterfly&quot;. Philippe will be involved in this feature film as an actor, writer, among an international and Award winning cast. Presently the main project that brings Philippe to the US is a spectacular feature film drama entitled &quot;The Devil Never Sleeps&quot;, by director Ralph Server, winner of the 2004 New York Independent Film Festival with the film &quot;Without Mercy&quot;. Philippe has been approached by writer-director Ralph Server to play the lead role in this unique drama, in the style of &quot;Ocean 11&quot;, and was seduced by the depth and complexity of his character. This role went to Alain Delon 15 years ago before the sudden death of one of the producers, Boris Sagal, that stopped the production of the film at that time. An international cast with American names and a number of outstanding upcoming and known young actresses will be part of &quot;The Devil Never Sleeps&quot;. Philippe&apos;s fascination for westerns took an unexpected turn when a director from New York asked Philippe to play a co leading role in a western. Enthusiastic, Philippe accepted the role and even trained to look and act like a real cowboy. His previous experience as a cowboy in the play Fool for Love was helpful. On a personal level, Philippe has been engaged three times. His last love story sadly ended at the end of the year 2009 after 3 years. Although Philippe likes to say that being engaged to a girl with all the qualities a man desires and who is not in the same business was such a relief. But life goes on. Philippe has recently been dating a beautiful and talented young woman. Is she or not involved in the acting world? A love story to be continued...</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Jenny &quot;Nef&quot; Hale was born and raised in a northwest suburb of Chicago in Illinois. She is the twin sister of &apos;Lisa Hale (II)&apos; (qv), a Chicago-based costume designer for theater and film.  She took her first steps into the entertainment world when she began violin lessons in 1994 under the tutelage of Celeste Lake. During this time, Jenny was a member of the symphony, concert, and competition orchestra. In 1998, she learned how to play the cello, but abandoned the instrument, favoring the more affordable and lighter-weight violin. She continued studying and playing the violin under the instruction of Kendall Hastings. During that time, she was a member of several symphony, concert, and competition orchestras. She also played in the pit orchestra, which accompanied productions including Fiddler on the Roof and Oliver.  In the summer of 2002, she began her studies at Dominican University in Illinois where she specialized in secondary education and received endorsements in mathematics and French, the latter of which she had already been studying since 1996. Not completely abandoning her music career, it was also during this time that she became a part of the Rosary Chapel music ensemble for special events. She also freelanced, playing in a music group for local weddings.  It was also at university when she and her sister professionally joined forces, the likes of which continues to this day. In 2005, Jenny walked in her first fashion show, modeling a piece her sister designed, which earned her the &quot;Up-and-Coming Designer&quot; award. While Jenny has since modeled in over 80 fashion shows in Chicago for other designers like &apos;Calvin Tran&apos; (qv) and Borris Powell, she continues to work with her sister on a variety of projects. Every year since 2009, she has exhibition modeled at several comic and entertainment conventions, helping showcase her sister&apos;s movie-replicated costume designs, which have been featured on several media sites including NBC and MTV Geek.  During the fall of 2011, Jenny caught the acting bug when, through her fashion industry connections, she booked her first background artist role as a Daily Planet employee in &apos;Zack Snyder&apos; (qv)&apos;s blockbuster movie, _Man of Steel (2013)_ (qv). That same year, she began training in classical ballet at the Joffery Ballet&apos;s Academy of Dance. Her skills helped her land the role of a dancing nymph in Mozart&apos;s Die Zauberflöte (the Magic Flute) at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. During the same season, she also played an Ethiopian slave in Verdi&apos;s Aida. In the winter of 2012, she teamed up with her sister yet again, this time to work on Rogue Lumen Productions&apos; first feature-length independent film, _Dorothy Marie and the Unanswered Questions of the Zombie Apocalypse (2013)_ (qv), in which she played a reanimated zombie, her first feature role.  Since then, she&apos;s appeared in the second season of _&quot;Boss&quot; (2011)_ (qv), playing Jackie&apos;s quirky assistant; _&quot;Underemployed&quot; (2012)_ (qv), playing a coffeehouse hipster; _Doubt (2013) (TV)_ (qv) and Mind Games (2013), playing a businesswoman; and most recently, &apos;Neil Burger&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Divergent (2014)_ (qv), playing an Erudite lab tech and assistant to the villainous Jeanine Matthews, played by &apos;Kate Winslet&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Undoubtedly one of the most influential film personalities in the history of film, Steven Spielberg is perhaps Hollywood&apos;s best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. Spielberg has countless big-grossing, critically acclaimed credits to his name, as producer, director and writer. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1946. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western _&quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1957)_ (qv). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed _Escape to Nowhere (1961)_ (qv), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister &apos;Anne Spielberg&apos; (qv), and _The Last Gun (1959)_ (qv), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed _Firelight (1964)_ (qv), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed _Slipstream (1967)_ (qv), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed _Amblin&apos; (1968)_ (qv), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin&apos; also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, _Duel (1971) (TV)_ (qv), with &apos;Dennis Weaver (I)&apos; (qv). In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as &apos;Rod Serling&apos; (qv)&apos;s _&quot;Night Gallery&quot; (1969)_ (qv), _&quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (1969)_ (qv) and _&quot;Columbo&quot; (1971) {Murder by the Book (#1.1)}_ (qv). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.  Spielberg&apos;s first major directorial effort was _The Sugarland Express (1974)_ (qv), with &apos;Goldie Hawn&apos; (qv), a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: _Jaws (1975)_ (qv). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic _Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)_ (qv), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable _I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978)_ (qv), and followed that effort with _Used Cars (1980)_ (qv), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, &apos;Kurt Russell (I)&apos; (qv)\\&apos;Jack Warden&apos; (qv) comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv), with &apos;Harrison Ford (I)&apos; (qv) taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was _Poltergeist (1982)_ (qv), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reece&apos;s Pieces in &quot;E.T.&quot; Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up &quot;Raiders&quot; with _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)_ (qv), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as _The Goonies (1985)_ (qv), and was the brains behind the little monsters in _Gremlins (1984)_ (qv). He also produced the cartoon _An American Tail (1986)_ (qv), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster _Back to the Future (1985)_ (qv), which made &apos;Michael J. Fox (I)&apos; (qv) an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book _The Color Purple (1985)_ (qv), with &apos;Whoopi Goldberg&apos; (qv) and &apos;Oprah Winfrey&apos; (qv), with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed _Empire of the Sun (1987)_ (qv), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.  The late 1980s found Spielberg&apos;s projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film _Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)_ (qv). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed _Always (1989)_ (qv) as well as _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv), and _Back to the Future Part II (1989)_ (qv). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama _Dad (1989)_ (qv), with &apos;Jack Lemmon&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ted Danson&apos; (qv), which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, he produced the animated series _&quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; (1990)_ (qv), _&quot;Animaniacs&quot; (1993)_ (qv), _&quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; (1995)_ (qv), _&quot;Freakazoid!&quot; (1995)_ (qv), _&quot;Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain&quot; (1998)_ (qv), _&quot;Family Dog&quot; (1993)_ (qv) and _&quot;Toonsylvania&quot; (1998)_ (qv). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as _The Land Before Time (1988)_ (qv), _We&apos;re Back! A Dinosaur&apos;s Story (1993)_ (qv), _Casper (1995)_ (qv) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of _The Flintstones (1994)_ (qv), where he was credited as &quot;Steven Spielrock&quot;. Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed _Hook (1991)_ (qv) and produced such films as the cute fantasy _Joe Versus the Volcano (1990)_ (qv) and _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991)_ (qv). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller _Arachnophobia (1990)_ (qv), _Back to the Future Part III (1990)_ (qv) and _Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)_ (qv). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed _Schindler&apos;s List (1993)_ (qv), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.  As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv), _Men in Black (1997)_ (qv) and _Deep Impact (1998)_ (qv). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic _Amistad (1997)_ (qv), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to _Shakespeare in Love (1998)_ (qv).  Spielberg produced a series of films, including _Evolution (2001)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Shrek (2001)_ (qv). he also produced two sequels to _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: _&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001)_ (qv), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director&apos;s chair for _Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001)_ (qv), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.  Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series _&quot;SeaQuest DSV&quot; (1993)_ (qv), an anthology series entitled _&quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (1985)_ (qv), created the video-game series &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of _&quot;ER&quot; (1994)_ (qv). Spielberg, if you haven&apos;t noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) collaborated on _Shooting War (2000) (TV)_ (qv), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called _A Holocaust szemei (2000)_ (qv). With all of this to Spielberg&apos;s credit, it&apos;s no wonder that he&apos;s looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.</biography>

      <biography>Cyrus King was born in Redwood City, California in the summer of 1978. Home-grown in San Francisco&apos;s East Bay area, his father is a Persian engineer and his mother an Irish-German nurse. They settled in Hayward, a suburb of Oakland and Cyrus soon started to learn the hard knocks of blue collar life.  Cruising through school without giving acting much thought, he managed to take and pass a drama class his freshman year in high school; the only class he would actually pass that year. It wouldn&apos;t be until the age of twenty while attending college in Chico, California that he would be cast in numerous short films and plays, some of which won awards at local film festivals.  Deciding that a college degree wouldn&apos;t necessarily guarantee work, he stepped up to the L.A. arena in 2001, and since then he&apos;s been featured on the hit shows E.R., nip/tuck, and C.S.I.: Miami.  Great roles in feature films are no stranger to him either; they include: an FBI agent in Steven Spielberg&apos;s &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot;, and an M.P. (Military Police) in Academy Award winning director Errol Morris&apos; &quot;Standard Operating Procedure&quot;.  Known for his hard-knock, authoritative and military characters and his clever takes on life, Cyrus&apos; style of story-telling through film will continue to be action-packed, dramatic and comical.</biography>

      <birthName>Pepper, Barry Robert</birthName>
      <biography>Barry Robert Pepper was born on April 4, 1970, in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada, as the youngest of three sons. He has two older brothers named Alex and Doug Pepper. The Peppers didn&apos;t stick around Campbell River for too long. They had been building a ship in their backyard for years. When Barry was five years old, the ship was done and the family set sail. The ship, named &quot;The Moonlighter,&quot; was a 50-foot craft that would be their home for the next five years. They navigated through the South Pacific islands, using only a sextant and the stars as guides. While visiting such exotic locales as Fiji and Tahiti, Barry was educated through correspondence courses and sometimes enrolled in public schools. He grew up around Polynesian children and credits them for his love of dance, music and other expressive arts. Barry had plenty of time to practice his newfound loves, too. Without television as entertainment on the ship, the family relied on games and sketch acting for fun. When the five-year cruise was over, the Peppers returned to their native Canada, where they set up shop on a small island off the West Coast near Vancouver. They built a farm on the outskirts of a small artists&apos; town, which was populated mainly by hippies, poets, musicians and other craftsmen. While in high school, Barry was enthusiastic about art and excelled in sports. In addition to playing volleyball, he was an excellent rugby player. He graduated in 1988 from George P. Vanier High School in Courtenay and then enrolled in college and majored in marketing and graphic design, but after getting involved with the Vancouver Actors Studio, he changed his course. Once again, he was using &quot;the stars&quot; to navigate. Barry landed his first role on _&quot;Madison&quot; (1993)_ (qv) (a sort of Canadian 90210) and other prominent television series before moving on to more prestigious roles in the US. Television movies followed, most notably the mini-series _Titanic (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which costarred &apos;George C. Scott&apos; (qv). Still, Barry&apos;s career really wasn&apos;t taking off. He was a hard-working actor, but not a star. That all changed in 1998. After a string of big screen duds, Pepper obtained his breakthrough role as a Bible-quoting sniper in &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s WW II drama _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). With the success of the film came sudden stardom for its cast--complete with photo spreads, interviews and even some Oscar buzz. Barry followed the film with a small but noteworthy role in the blockbuster, _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Will Smith (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gene Hackman&apos; (qv). Next he co-starred in an Oscar-worthy film starring &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv): &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Green Mile (1999)_ (qv). Barry received much critical acclaim in 2001 for his portrayal of &apos;Roger Maris (I)&apos; (qv) in the made-for-cable drama about the 1961 home run race between Maris and &apos;Mickey Mantle&apos; (qv) called _61* (2001) (TV)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Kelly, James Martin</birthName>
      <biography>James Martin Kelly was born in 1954 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. Within a few years he moved to suburban Valley Stream, Long Island where at the age of 11 he performed on stage as a musician singing, playing the guitar and drums. By the 1980s Jim was a published songwriter and performer working in the recording studios and nightclubs of New York in lower Manhattan. To supplement his income and now married to Mary-Ellen of Long Island and with children, Jim became a postman with the US Postal Service. He secured a transfer to Hudson, Florida, but once there he realized there were many less opportunities in the music industry that he loved so much. His wife saw an advertisement on the television for auditions for the community theater and encouraged Jim to go, where he soon learned the trade of rejection. But he didn&apos;t give up. He played Beadle in &quot;Sweeny Todd&quot; at the Richey Suncoast Theater. A director of another show saw Jim and booked him in his show, this led to one engagement after another including Alan Squire in &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;. Jim at this time had agents in the Tampa area and they were sending him out on several auditions landing him work in commercials. Being in constant demand he had to make the choice whether to take the risk and leave the Post Office or pursue his acting career full time. He chose the latter and has no regrets at all. He decided to go with the agent that got him the best and most consistent work, which was Melanie Hurt of the Hurt Agency, Orlando. He has attended workshops with Kathy Laughlin in Tampa, Lori Wyman in Miami and several others. He spent 3 years learning the Eric Morris Technique at the Performers Studio perfecting scene study. Recently he attended a Primetime Audition workshop in New York with &apos;Julie Tucker&apos; who casts for the TV show _&quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999) _. Jim has appeared on _&quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1993)_ (qv) as mob boss Billy Bob Jackson in three episodes where his New York accent came in handy. He also appeared in _&quot;Safe Harbor&quot; (1999)_ (qv). In _&quot;Noah Knows Best&quot; (2000)_ (qv), shot at Universal, he played Big Frankie, Hanson&apos;s bodyguard. Jim played &quot;Mack&apos; the owner of the Big Ace Saloon on _&quot;Dawson&apos;s Creek&quot; (1998)_ (qv). In between theater and television, he hosted his own show: &quot;Kelly&apos;s Cellar&quot;, on public television, when he and his wife produced the series. His guests consisted of comedians, musicians and actors and ran for two years.  Some of his films include _Olive Juice (2001)_ (qv), which recently premiered in Orlando. In _Animal Factory (2000)_ (qv) with &apos;Steve Buscemi&apos; (qv) and &apos;Willem Dafoe&apos; (qv), he played a correctional guard who has a rough face-to-face confrontation with Davoe. His most recent film, shot in Miami, was _Big Trouble (2002)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Barry Sonnerfeld&apos;, when he played a Geo Salesman trying to sell a car. He also has a film To Kill A Lawyer (2001) soon to be shown at the Tampa Bay Film Festival. The film was shot in Tarpon Springs.  Jim is very proud of his eighteen-year-old daughter Amanda who was given a full scholarship to Southern Methodist University for vocal performance. Music seems to run in the family. His sixteen-year-old daughter, Vanessa, is interested in acting and film. Her fascination seems to be in continuity in films. Thirteen-year-old Jim Jr. is into painting, sculpting and now his historical interest is in building ancient medieval armaments. Colin, twelve, is into skateboarding. When not working as an actor, Jim spends all of his time with his family just hanging out together, living outside Los Angeles.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>17 September 1954</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Born in Memphis and raised in Philadelphia, Wendy started making student films in the summer of 1969 and began acting because she wanted to be able to write for and direct other actors. She discovered a love of acting that became a lifetime commitment, but only turned into a full-time pursuit when Jonathan Demme came to town to follow up his Academy Award with a groundbreaking drama about AIDS starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington.  Although she ended up on the cutting room floor of the movie &quot;Philadelphia,&quot; the experience gave her her SAG card and convinced her that it was time to leave behind her career as an arts administrator (co-founder of CineKyd, executive director of The Clay Studio, and various managerial jobs at People&apos;s Light and Theatre Company) and pursue acting full-time. Two weeks after arriving in Los Angeles, she was cast in a new musical, &quot;Lulu,&quot; for which she received a Drama-Logue Award, the first of many awards to come. Within a year, she had landed her first TV job, an appearance on &quot;Murphy Brown.&quot;  She continued to work regularly in TV and in theatre (helping to found Theatre Neo with Kathryn Joosten, Josh Schiowitz, and others), playing a wide range of roles from the murderous Lunch Lady on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (which earned her an appearance on her own trading card) to a recurring role as the formidable Margaret Camaro on &quot;Ally McBeal,&quot; &quot;Foodzilla&quot; on &quot;Even Stevens,&quot; and Miss Westmore (&quot;The Wicked Witch of the Westmore&quot;), teacher to the Olsen Twins on their most recent series, &quot;So Little Time.&quot;  She also began to make her mark in feature films, including a memorable turn as a lascivious casting director in &quot;LA Twister&quot; and Lenore, a high school receptionist described as &quot;cheerful and dumb as a stump&quot; in the upcoming drama &quot;In the Valley of Elah,&quot; written and directed by Academy Award winner Paul Haggis (&quot;Crash&quot;) and appearing opposite Tommy Lee Jones.  Wendy has the distinction of having played small roles in four different Tom Hanks movies: &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (don&apos;t look for her there, though, as she was edited out), &quot;Cast Away&quot; (in which she played one of Helen Hunt&apos;s aunts joining in the Christmas dinner early in the film), &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (a quick turn as a receptionist at TWA in a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio), and the soon-to-be-released &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; (in the memorable role of &quot;Oregon Woman&quot;).  Wendy is also a talented and experienced theatre director (her BA from Temple University, awarded summa cum laude, is in Radio-TV-Film) and a singer. And, although she grew up there, she does not have a Philadelphia accent - but she can do one on request.</biography>

      <biography>Suave and handsome Australian actor who came to Hollywood in the 1950s, and built himself up from a supporting actor into taking the lead in several well-remembered movies. Arguably his most fondly remembered role was that as George (Herbert George Wells), the inventor, in &apos;George Pal&apos; (qv)&apos;s spectacular _The Time Machine (1960)_ (qv). As the movie finished with George, and his best friend Filby &apos;Alan Young (I)&apos; (qv) seemingly parting forever, both actors were brought back together in 1993 to film a 30 minute epilogue to the original movie! Taylor&apos;s virile, matinée idol looks also assisted him in scoring the lead of Mitch Brenner in &apos;Alfred Hitchcock (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s creepy thriller _The Birds (1963)_ (qv), the role of &apos;Jane Fonda&apos; (qv)&apos;s love interest in _Sunday in New York (1963)_ (qv), the title role in &apos;John Ford (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s biopic of Irish playwright &apos;Sean O&apos;Casey&apos; (qv) in _Young Cassidy (1965)_ (qv), and a co-starring role in _The Train Robbers (1973)_ (qv) with &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv). Taylor also appeared as &apos;Bette Davis&apos; (qv) future son-in-law in the well-received film _The Catered Affair (1956)_ (qv). He also gave a sterling performance as the German-American Nazi Major trying to fool &apos;James Garner (I)&apos; (qv) in _36 Hours (1965)_ (qv). Later Taylor made many westerns and action movies during the 1960s and 1970s; however, none of them were much better than &quot;B pictures&quot; and failed to push his star to the next level. Aditionally, Taylor was cast as the lead in several TV series including _&quot;Bearcats!&quot; (1971)_ (qv), _&quot;Masquerade&quot; (1983)_ (qv), and _&quot;Outlaws&quot; (1986)_ (qv); however, none of them truly ignited viewer interest, and they were canceled after only one or two seasons. Most fans would agree that Rod Taylor&apos;s last great role was in the wonderful Australian film _The Picture Show Man (1977)_ (qv), about a traveling side show bringing &quot;moving pictures&quot; to remote towns in the Australian outback.</biography>

Most recently Jillian has been seen in guest star stints for ABC&apos;s _&quot;Castle&quot; (2009)_ (qv) and Nickelodeon&apos;s Emmy nominated episodes of _&quot;Victorious&quot; (2010)_ (qv) titled Freak The Freak Out.

Aside from performing, Jillian lends her support to a variety of causes geared toward children and her four-legged friends. Her entrepreneurial skills have recently led her to join the ranks of blogging with the launch of Teenage Wonderland - a fashion and beauty blog for young women.  Jillian created her production company, &apos;Whimsical Entertainment [us]&apos; in 2012 as a creative outlet to produce projects that she&apos;s passionate about. Touting the tagline &quot;A production company for the eclectic&quot;, Miss Clare intends to tell stories that have an impact on society and an everlasting impression with the audience.</biography>

      <biography>With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Born in June 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, the young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.  Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of &apos;Lee Breuer&apos; (qv)&apos;s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in &apos;Alfred Uhry&apos; (qv)&apos;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival&apos;s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite &apos;Tracey Ullman&apos; (qv). Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with &apos;Frances McDormand&apos; (qv) and &apos;Peter Gallagher (I)&apos; (qv) in &apos;Clifford Odets&apos; (qv)&apos; drama The Country Girl, directed by &apos;Mike Nichols (I)&apos; (qv).  Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including &quot;Easy Reader&quot;, &quot;Mel Mounds&quot; and &quot;Count Dracula&quot; on the Children&apos;s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show _&quot;The Electric Company&quot; (1971)_ (qv). He then moved into feature film with another children&apos;s adventure, _Who Says I Can&apos;t Ride a Rainbow! (1971)_ (qv). Next, there was a small role in the thriller _Blade (1973)_ (qv); then he played Casca in _Julius Caesar (1979) (V)_ (qv) and the title role in _Coriolanus (1979) (V)_ (qv). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas _Attica (1980) (TV)_ (qv) and _Brubaker (1980)_ (qv), _Eyewitness (1981)_ (qv), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in _Death of a Prophet (1981) (TV)_ (qv). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in _Street Smart (1987)_ (qv) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of _Driving Miss Daisy (1989)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Jessica Tandy&apos; (qv). The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful &apos;Matthew Broderick (I)&apos; (qv) and fiery &apos;Denzel Washington&apos; (qv) in the epic Civil War drama _Glory (1989)_ (qv) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.  His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in _The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)_ (qv), _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)_ (qv), and _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). Freeman&apos;s next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv)&apos;s de-mythologized western _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for &apos;Gene Hackman&apos; (qv), a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on _Bopha! (1993)_ (qv) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.  More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker &apos;Tim Robbins (I)&apos; (qv) in _The Shawshank Redemption (1994)_ (qv). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in _Se7en (1995)_ (qv), starred alongside &apos;Keanu Reeves&apos; (qv) in _Chain Reaction (1996)_ (qv), and was pursuing another serial murderer in _Kiss the Girls (1997)_ (qv).  Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of _Amistad (1997)_ (qv), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in _Deep Impact (1998)_ (qv), appeared in &apos;Neil LaBute&apos; (qv)&apos;s black comedy _Nurse Betty (2000)_ (qv), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in _Along Came a Spider (2001)_ (qv). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama _The Sum of All Fears (2002)_ (qv), was a military officer in the &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)-inspired _Dreamcatcher (2003)_ (qv), gave divine guidance as God to &apos;Jim Carrey&apos; (qv) in _Bruce Almighty (2003)_ (qv), and played a minor role in the comedy _The Big Bounce (2004)_ (qv).  2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv) to appear in the drama, _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv). Freeman&apos;s on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie &quot;Scrap Iron&quot; Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv). Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy&apos;s judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s _War of the Worlds (2005)_ (qv) and appeared in _Batman Begins (2005)_ (qv) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of &apos;Christian Bale&apos; (qv)&apos;s Bruce Wayne/Batman for director &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv). Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.  Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in _Lucky Number Slevin (2006)_ (qv), a second go-round as God in _Evan Almighty (2007)_ (qv) with &apos;Steve Carell&apos; (qv) taking over for &apos;Jim Carrey&apos; (qv), and a supporting role in &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv)&apos;s directorial debut, _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv). He co-starred with &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv) in the breakout hit _The Bucket List (2007)_ (qv) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, _Wanted (2008)_ (qv), then segued into the second Batman film, _The Dark Knight (2008)_ (qv).  In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director&apos;s true-life drama _Invictus (2009)_ (qv), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of &apos;Nelson Mandela&apos; (qv) in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics&apos; Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.  Recently, Freeman appeared in _RED (2010)_ (qv), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the _Conan the Barbarian (2011)_ (qv) remake, starred in &apos;Rob Reiner&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Magic of Belle Isle (2012)_ (qv); and capped the Batman trilogy with _The Dark Knight Rises (2012)_ (qv). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller _Now You See Me (2013/I)_ (qv), under the direction of &apos;Louis Leterrier&apos; (qv), and the science fiction actioner _Oblivion (2013/I)_ (qv), in which he stars with &apos;Tom Cruise&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Jamie&apos;s mother, Louise, was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed, his grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age 7 months, adopted him too. He says he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, &quot;Peep This&quot; and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _&quot;Roc&quot; (1991)_ (qv) and _&quot;In Living Color&quot; (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series. He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.</biography>

He was inspired to be an actor at an early age by his great-grandfather &apos;George Irving (I)&apos; (qv), a very prominent actor and director of the early 20th century.

Grace dropped out of USC to start his show business career in _&quot;That &apos;70s Show&quot; (1998)_ (qv) at age 20.

      <birthName>Llewelyn, Desmond Wilkinson</birthName>
      <biography>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school&apos;s productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department&apos;s physical exam. &quot;Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn&apos;t take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test.&quot; After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry &quot;was definitely not for me.&quot; Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn&apos;s company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that &quot;eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there,&quot; and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called &quot;a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice.&quot; After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Albert R. Broccoli&apos; (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he &quot;was quite disappointed&quot; at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. &quot;I&apos;d love to be in the next one,&quot; Llewelyn said. &quot;Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago.&quot;</biography>

      <birthName>Adams, Amy Lou</birthName>
      <biography>Amy Lou Adams was born in Italy, to American parents Kathryn (Hicken) and Richard Kent Adams, while her father was a U.S. serviceman. She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado.  Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder&apos;s Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as &quot;Brigadoon&quot; and &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work.  Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in _Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)_ (qv), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, &apos;Kirstie Alley&apos; (qv) encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, _Cruel Intentions (1999)_ (qv), in the part played in the film by &apos;Sarah Michelle Gellar&apos; (qv), &quot;Kathryn Merteuil&quot;. Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video _Cruel Intentions 2 (2000) (V)_ (qv). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv), playing opposite &apos;Leonardo DiCaprio&apos; (qv). But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, _&quot;Dr. Vegas&quot; (2004)_ (qv).  Her role in the low-budget independent film _Junebug (2005)_ (qv) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of &quot;Giselle&quot; in the animated/live-action feature film, _Enchanted (2007)_ (qv), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.  Adams next appeared in the major production, _Charlie Wilson&apos;s War (2007)_ (qv), and went on to act in the independent film, _Sunshine Cleaning (2008)_ (qv), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as &quot;Sister James&quot; in _Doubt (2008/I)_ (qv) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as &apos;Amelia Earhart&apos; (qv) in _Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009)_ (qv) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in _Julie &amp; Julia (2009)_ (qv). More recently, she starred with &apos;Jason Segel&apos; (qv) in _The Muppets (2011)_ (qv) and alongside &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv) in _Trouble with the Curve (2012)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Clark, Richard Wagstaff</birthName>
      <biography>Dick Clark was born and raised in Mount Vernon, New York on November 30, 1929 to Julia Fuller and Richard Augustus Clark. He had one older brother, Bradley, who was killed in World War II. At the age of 16, Clark got his first job in the mailroom of WRUN, a radio station in Utica, New York, which was owned by his uncle and managed by his father. He worked his way up the ranks and was promoted to weatherman before becoming a radio announcer. After graduating from Syracuse University with a degree in business administration, Clark began working at several radio and television stations before landing at WFIL radio in 1952. While working at the station, Clark became a substitute host for Bob Horn&apos;s Bandstand, an afternoon program where teenagers danced to popular music, broadcast by WFIL&apos;s affiliated television station. In 1956, Horn was arrested for drunk driving, giving Clark the perfect opportunity to step in as the full-time host.  After acquiring nationwide distribution the newly reformatted program, now titled &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, premiered on ABC on August 5, 1957. In addition to the name change, Clark added interviews with artists (starting with Elvis Presley), lip-sync performances, and &quot;Rate-a-Record,&quot; allowing teens to judge the songs on the show - and giving birth to the popular phrase, &quot;It&apos;s got a good beat and you can dance to it.&quot; Clark also established a formal dress code, mandating dresses and skirts for the women and a coat and tie for the men. But perhaps the most impactful change that Clark made to the show was ending &quot;American Bandstand&apos;s&quot; all-white policy, allowing African American artists to perform on the show.  Under Clark&apos;s influence, &quot;Bandstand&quot; became one of the most successful and longest-running musical programs, featuring artists including Chuck Berry, the Doors, the Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, and Smokey Robinson. Sonny and Cher, The Jackson 5, Prince, and Aerosmith were among the influential artists and bands that made their television debuts on &quot;Bandstand&quot;, which is also credited with helping to make America more accepting of rock &apos;n&apos; roll.  With the success of &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, Clark became more invested in the music publishing and recording businesses, and began managing artists, hosting live sock hops, and arranging concert tours. But in 1960, when the United States Senate began investigating &quot;payola&quot;, the practice in which music producing companies paid broadcasting companies to favor their products, Clark became caught up in the scandal. The investigation found he had partial copyrights to over 150 songs, many of which were featured on his show. Clark denied he was involved in any way, but admitted to accepting a fur and jewelry from a record company president. In the end, the Senate could not find any illegal actions by Clark, but ABC asked Clark to either sell his shares in these companies or leave the network so there was no conflict of interest. He chose to sell and continue on as host of &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, which was unaffected by the scandal.  In 1964, Clark moved Bandstand from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and became more involved in television production. Under his company Dick Clark Productions, he produced such shows as &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;, &quot;TV&apos;s Bloopers and Practical Jokes&quot;, and more recently, &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, as well as made-for-television movies including &quot;Elvis&quot;, &quot;The Birth of the Beatles&quot;, &quot;Wild Streets&quot;, and &quot;The Savage Seven&quot;. Clark also hosted television&apos;s &quot;$10,000 Pyramid&quot;, &quot;TV Bloopers and Practical Jokes&quot; (with co-host Ed McMahon), &quot;Scattergories&quot;, and &quot;The Other Half&quot;. Clark also had several radio programs, including &quot;The Dick Clark National Music Survey&quot;, &quot;Countdown America&quot;, and &quot;Rock, Roll &amp; Remember&quot;.  In 1972, he produced and hosted the very first edition of &quot;Dick Clark&apos;s New Year&apos;s Rockin&apos; Eve&quot;, a musical program where Clark counted down until the New Year ball dropped in Times Square, featuring taped performances from musical artists. &quot;New Year&apos;s Rockin&apos; Eve&quot; soon became a cultural tradition, airing on ABC every year with Clark as host (except in 1999 when ABC aired &quot;ABC 2000: Today&quot;, a news milestone program hosted by Peter Jennings). In December 2004, Clark suffered a minor stroke and was unable to host, so Regis Philbin stepped in as a substitute. The following year, Clark returned as co-host alongside primary host Ryan Seacrest. Many were worried about Clark due to his slurred and breathless speech, and he admitted on-air he was still recovering but that he wouldn&apos;t have missed the broadcast for the world. The following year, Seacrest became &quot;New Year&apos;s Rockin&apos; Eve&apos;s&quot; primary host, but Clark always returned for the countdown.  Clark has received several notable awards including four Emmy Awards, the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Peabody Award in 1999. He was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1976, The Radio Hall of Fame in 1990, Broadcasting Magazine Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame. Clark had been in St. John&apos;s hospital in Los Angeles after undergoing an outpatient procedure the night of April 17, 2012. Clark suffered a massive heart attack following the procedure. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful and he died the next morning of April 18, 2012.</biography>

      <biography>Malachi Throne, the character actor who became one of the more ubiquitous faces on television from the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the 1950s through the 21st Century, was born in New York City on December 1, 1928, the son of Samuel and Rebecca Throne, who had immigrated to America from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He began performing at an early age.  During World War Two, the young Malachi quit school to work in theater, though he later returned and got his high school diploma. He then set out upon a life as a &quot;wandering player&quot;, as he describes it, playing in summer and winter stock companies while matriculating at Brooklyn College and Long Island University. Though he loved acting, he believed he&apos;d eventually wind up as an English teacher, which is why he doggedly kept at his studies between tours.  When he was 21 years old, the Korean Conflict broke out, and Throne wound up in the infantry attached to an armored unit. When he returned to the New York theatrical scene, he found out that the revolution &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) had started in 1947 playing Stanley Kowalski in _A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)_ (qv) was now the status quo.  Possessed of a deep, classically trained voice, Throne was cast in the parts of characters much older than his actual age. His clear enunciation also made him a natural for live television, and he went to work on the now-defunct DuMont TV network. He continued his acting studies in New York, tutored by such luminaries as &apos;Uta Hagen&apos; (qv) and &apos;William Hickey (I)&apos; (qv).  In addition to TV, he continued to work on the the stage, appearing in the landmark Off-Broadway production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, in support of &apos;Jason Robards&apos; (qv). He also played in the famous Off-Broadway revivals of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; and &apos;Clifford Odets&apos; (qv)&apos; &quot;Rocket To The Moon&quot;, as well as appeared on Broadway in such top shows as &apos;Jean Anouilh (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Becket&quot; in support of &apos;Laurence Olivier&apos; (qv).  In 1958-59, he found himself in California, playing a season at San Deigo&apos;s Old Globe Theater. After his stint with the Globe was over, he went north, to Hollywood, and established himself as a major character actor in guest spots on series television during the 1960s. He had memorable appearances as &quot;Falseface&quot; on the Batman TV series and provided the voice of &quot;The Keeper&quot; for &quot;The Cage&quot;, the pilot episode of the _&quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966)_ (qv) series. He turned down an offer to be a regular cast member on that show, rejecting the part of Dr. McCoy as he did not want to play third fiddle to &apos;William Shatner&apos; (qv) and &apos;Leonard Nimoy&apos; (qv). Producer &apos;Gene Roddenberry&apos; (qv), who had offered him the role of &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy, was not offended by Throne turning him down, and cast him as &quot;Commodore Mendez&quot; in the two-part episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, which included most of the original pilot, although by then The Keeper&apos;s voice had been re-dubbed by another actor. He also later played &quot;Senator Pardac&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; two-part episode &quot;Unification,&quot; appearing with Leonard Nimoy, whose Mr. Spock was the role he had coveted a generation before.  In 1968, two years after &quot;Star Trek&quot; debuted, Throne was cast as &apos;Robert Wagner (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s boss on the TV show _&quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; (1968)_ (qv) while continuing to guest on other TV shows. Throne also remained committed to the stage, appearing as a resident actor with a variety of regional theaters, including the SanFrancisco Actors&apos; Workshop, the Los Angeles Inner City Repertory Co., the MarkTaper Forum and the Louisville Free Theatre.  Malachi Throne lives in southern California, where he appears in local theater. When not acting, he writes historical novels. His two sons are also in show business: Zachary Throne is an actor/musician while Joshua Throne is a Producer/Unit Production Manager.</biography>

      <birthName>Siegel, Jerome</birthName>
      <biography>Jerry Siegel was born in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1931, he met and befriended his future partner, Joe Shuster, when the latter moved from his birthplace in Canada. Siegel and Shuster were both avid science fiction fans, publishing a fanzine in the mid-1920s. It was during this period that they read Philip Wylie&apos;s book, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, about a mysterious character with superpowers and invulnerability. They created a strip for their fanzine (Shuster drawing, Siegel writing) featuring a super-powered villian, but later made him into a hero. In 1936, they tried, unsuccessfully, to turn it into a daily comic strip. About the same time, both young men got a job working for DC-National (now DC Comics), working on such titles as Doctor Occult, Slam Bradley, and Radio Squad. Siegel also created and worked on the Spectre In 1939, DC editor Sheldon Meyer decided to give the two young men a chance, and published their character Superman a new comic title, &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Superman was an almost imediate hit, spawning his own eponymous title within a year, then going on to be featured in virtually every type of media.  Siegel and Shuster continued working on Superman for many years, but became increasingly resentful of the profits that DC-National made off their character (because of the practice at the time, the creators had signed away all rights to the character to the publisher). In 1946, Shuster and Siegel sued DC for a share of the rights to Superman (their lawyer was &apos;Albert Zugsmith&apos; (qv)). The case dragged on until 1948, when the two men settled for royalties only on the Superboy character. They were also required to sign away any future claims to the Superman character.  Shuster left the comic field, while Seigel left DC to become comics editor at Ziff-Davis Publications during the 1950s. Without his long-time partner, however, Siegel found the creative spark to be missing, and gradually lost work. Finally, Siegel&apos;s wife went to DC&apos;s publisher and told them, &quot;Do you really want to read the headline &quot;Superman Creator Starves to Death&apos;?&quot;, and asked for the comic publisher to give him uncredited work.  Siegel wrote many Superman stories in the 1960s, including many about Superman&apos;s home planet Krypton. In 1964, however, DC once again let Siegel go. He moved to Los Angeles, where he became a virtual recluse. In 1975, after the Superman movie raised new interest in the character, the two men once again sued DC for recognition and royalties. DC, with much prodding from publisher/editor &apos;Carmine Infantino&apos; (qv), re-instated Siegel and Shuster&apos;s name on the masthead as creators, and awarded the two men an annual stipend of $35,000. Finally receiving the recognition he deserved, Siegel became recognized as one of the pioneers of the comics industries. In 1999, his heirs&apos; finally won their court case with DC and received 50% ownership and control of Superman.</biography>

      <biography>Actor Kyle Davis was born in Downey, California. He lived there until he moved at the age of 14, with his parents to Arizona. Kyle attended Sedona Red Rock High School and later he went on to study photography at Yavapi Community College. After his brief stay at Yavapi Community College, Kyle intended to enlist in the military, but months before departing, he was involved in a fight that left him blind in his left eye.  In 1998 Kyle moved back to Southern California to pursue his dream at becoming a professional Skateboarder. A short while after moving he tore his ACL. Kyle&apos;s cousin pushed him to consider acting after the injury.  Kyle began his acting career at the age of 20. For quick money, he got his first camera appearance on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; and started working as an extra for various shows and commercials. He was against using an acting coach and determined to teach himself. Kyle used a video camera and answering machine to help perfect his acting skills.  Kyle learned the other end of the business when he took a job working with a talent agency. He also worked with several casting directors. He was later hired on as a professional reader, reading for Jamie Foxx in &quot;Collateral.&quot;  Kyle got his SAG card after working on a Jack in the Box commercial. Since then his career took off. Kyle started doing guest spots on &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;CSI&quot;, &quot;The Shield&quot; and more.  Most recently he was cast along with Sophia Bush and Sean Bean in Dave Meyers&apos; remake of &quot;The Hitcher&quot;.  Kyle has been in over 70 commercials and 15 films and at least 20 television guest appearances.  Kyle resides in North Hollywood with his wife 2 dogs and 3 cats.</biography>

Michael France was born in 1962. He graduated from the University of Florida and attended Columbia University&apos;s School Of The Arts.  His breakthrough screenplay was his 1991 spec sale for Cliffhanger to Carolco Pictures - the movie was shot within the year and became a worldwide hit in 1993 for Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin. France then went on to revive the then-dormant James Bond franchise with his script for GoldenEye, which again yielded a worldwide hit in 1995 - and France&apos;s association with the James Bond franchise continued with uncredited work in The World Is Not Enough, which was released in 1999.  France&apos;s string of Marvel adaptations began with Hulk (2003) for Universal Pictures, continued with The Punisher (2004) for Lions Gate, and went further with the blockbuster release of Fantastic Four (2005) for Twentieth Century Fox.  He lived in Florida with his wife Elizabeth, son Thomas, and twin daughters Annabelle and Carolynn. He died in April 2013 aged 51.</biography>

      <birthName>Walken, Ronald</birthName>
      <biography>Amazingly versatile stage &amp; screen actor with sandy colored hair, pale complexion and a somewhat nervous disposition. Has a reputation for playing mentally unbalanced characters on-screen, however that generalisation would not do justice to Walken&apos;s depth and breadth of performances. He learnt his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University &amp; ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the &apos;Tennessee Williams&apos; (qv) play &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;.  Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in _Me and My Brother (1969)_ (qv), before appearing alongside &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv) in the sleeper heist movie _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of &apos;Diane Keaton&apos; (qv) suicidal younger brother in _Annie Hall (1977)_ (qv), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying _The Deer Hunter (1978)_ (qv). Walken was lured back by _The Deer Hunter (1978)_ (qv) director &apos;Michael Cimino (I)&apos; (qv) for a role in the financially disastrous western _Heaven&apos;s Gate (1980)_ (qv), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in _Pennies from Heaven (1981)_ (qv), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv) inspired _The Dead Zone (1983)_ (qv) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv).  Looking at many of Walken&apos;s other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in _Biloxi Blues (1988)_ (qv), _Wayne&apos;s World 2 (1993)_ (qv), _Joe Dirt (2001)_ (qv), _Mousehunt (1997)_ (qv) and _America&apos;s Sweethearts (2001)_ (qv). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to &apos;Leonardo DiCaprio&apos; (qv) in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv). Christopher Walken&apos;s talents continue to remain in high demand and movie audiences relish watching how capably he re-invents himself for each new challenging role.</biography>

In 1991 she appeared in her first film, _Shout (1991)_ (qv), with &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv). That same year she met &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv), who gave her a small part in his film _Hook (1991)_ (qv). Her next roles were in made-for-television films, until she won rave reviews for her performance in _Flesh and Bone (1993)_ (qv). In 1994, she entered into a relationship with &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv), the older (by nine years) superstar who gave her a career boost by choosing her to play his wife in the hit thriller _Se7en (1995)_ (qv). But it was the title role of Emma Woodhouse in _Emma (1996)_ (qv) that fully tapped Gwyneth&apos;s capabilities and established her as a serious actress. She and Pitt broke off their much publicized engagement in 1997, citing as the reason the fact that neither felt that they could pursue their respective careers and at the same time maintain a happy marriage. They remain good friends. Meanwhile, Gwyneth&apos;s career has gone through the roof with the release of five glossy films in 1998, including _Great Expectations (1998)_ (qv), _Sliding Doors (1998)_ (qv), _A Perfect Murder (1998)_ (qv), and &apos;John Madden (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s masterpiece, _Shakespeare in Love (1998)_ (qv). Gwyneth&apos;s outstanding performance in the last film marked the greatest triumph of her career to date. She won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role.</biography>

      <biography>Wade Eastwood was born in Durban, South Africa in 1971, the youngest of 4 children. He finished junior school there before his family moved to England. The weather and lifestyle eventually forced a family decision to move back home to SA after 5 years. Once home, Wade finished high school, represented his country in Athletics (100M &amp; 200M sprints) and went in to the Army to complete his compulsory National Service.  Wade was 19 when he finished the army and landed his first film job. He had been working as a volunteer lifeguard and part of his duty included air sea rescue along Durban&apos;s beaches. A film company came to town and was scouting for soldier types to jump out of a helicopter as it flared to a stop over a crocodile infested river. Wade was chosen by the Director. After this stunt he was hooked and worked his way, (The hard way) through the ranks, driving, crashing, falling, burning etc....  After 7 years of performing and stunt coordinating feature films, TV shows and commercial&apos;s in South Africa, Wade wanted to move on to bigger and better projects with larger budgets and more scope to create unique action, thus he moved to the UK. Here he worked back to back doubling Brendan Fraser on The Mummy, Pierce Brosnan on The Bond Movies and Gerard Butler and Daniel Craig on The Tomb Raider Films, to name a few.  The only thing missing for Wade was the outdoor life, so he decided to make the move to California where he could work and still enjoy his hometown sports, such as surfing, climbing, motorcycle &amp; car racing etc...  Since moving to Los Angeles, Wade has stunt doubled Brad Pitt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ewan McGregor and many others as well as been nominated for 4 Taurus World Stunt awards for Best Stunt Coordination (Troy), best overall stunt by a stuntman (Terminator 3), best work with a vehicle (Terminator 3) and Best Stunt Coordinator (Salt).</biography>

      <biography>Dana Gourrier (pronounced Gu-Ree-A) is a native of New Orleans with ancestry dating back 7 generations. Since 8 years old she has been in front of audiences performing: be it singing, dancing, or acting. Her true love of theater began when she was 14 years old at the New Orleans Recreational Department Theater under the program&apos;s long-time, late director, Ty Tracy. After receiving her BFA in Performance Art from UL Lafayette, she went to New York in higher pursuits. She continued her studies participating in a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw Shakespeare in the Park&apos;s Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York. Eventually she found a tiny studio in Spanish Harlem, waited tables, auditioned, gigged, did background vocals, and even taught theater at a community center in Brooklyn. Dana has performed and also produced original work at: The Red Room Theater, Birdland, Lennox Lounge, Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, Under St. Mark&apos;s, The Cherry Lane Theater, Summer Stages in Central Park, and La Mama Theater. At La Mama Theater, Dana was apart of a project called Soulagraphie: a series of plays about genocide written by renowned playwright Eric Ehn. She played the title character Maria Kizito: a play about a Rwandan Nun that was tried and convicted of aiding in the death of thousands.  In 2010, Dana completed her MFA in Acting from the reputable California Institute of the Arts, where she was in two world premieres and a long list of other full theatrical productions both Classic and Contemporary. Upon graduating, she came straight home and broke into Hollywood South, as Film and Television were also her great loves. Dana had one goal when deciding to move back home; it was to be on HBO&apos;s Treme; the David Simon executively produced show about her hometown. Not only was she on it, but she landed a recurring role.  Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest Academy Award Winners and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Django Unchained. She felt so welcomed and connected to Quentin. She pitched ideas about her character to him, including a song for the funeral scene, which was shot, but would eventually land on the cutting room floor. Her next endeavor was working with Nominee Lee Daniels&apos; on his film, The Butler. She portrayed the role of Helen Holloway, wife of James Holloway, played by Lenny Kravitz.  Additionally, Dana has worked directly with Academy Award Winners and Nominees: Angela Bassett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Woody Harrelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Lang, Christoph Waltz, Forest Whitaker, and Oprah Winfrey!  Dana considers herself Tri-Costal, but currently resides in New Orleans, which will always be home.</biography>

      <birthName>Peters, John Pagano</birthName>
      <biography>Peters made his Hollywood debut in &apos;Cecil B. DeMille&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Ten Commandments (1956)_ (qv) as the boy on the donkey crossing the Red Sea. He went on to be a hard-case kid who spent his formative years in and out of reform school. Peters entered the family business of hairdressing at age 14. Armed with an instinctive genius for self-promotion, he amassed a huge celebrity clientele at his trendy Jon Peters Salon on Rodeo Drive, raking in millions by merchandising the salon&apos;s ancillary cosmetic products. Privy to confidences that the rich and famous only reveal to their hairdressers, Peters became hip to the ways and means of Hollywood. In 1974, he fell in love with his client &apos;Barbra Streisand&apos; (qv) and proceeded to manage her early music and film career. He produced her 1976 remake of _A Star Is Born (1976)_ (qv) which yielded over $100 million at the box office and four Oscar nominations including the Oscar-winning song, &quot;Evergreen&quot;. Peters went on to produce a string of best-selling Streisand albums, &quot;The Main Event&quot;, The Eyes of Laura Mars&quot; and &quot;Caddyshack&quot;. Peters blossomed into an A-list producer, a status he&apos;s maintained over 30 years.  In 1980, Peters teamed with former Casablanca Records and Filmworks exec &apos;Peter Guber&apos; (qv); together with Neil Bogart, Peters and Guber formed the Polygram Productions, later renamed the Boardwalk Company. A series of mergers and sell-offs later, Guber-Peters was born in 1983. The team&apos;s willingness to take enormous chances with huge amounts of money transformed Guber and Peters into the wunderkind of Hollywood, especially after such critical and financial successes as Missing (1982), Flashdance (1983), The Color Purple (1985), Witches of Eastwick (1987), Gorillas in the Mist (1988), and Rain Man (1989). Guber-Peters acquired Chuck Barris Productions (The Gong Show, The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game), cementing their role in television as Guber-Peters-Barris. The partnership took its biggest risk and scored its biggest hit with Batman (1989) which won Peters and his partner a multimillion-dollar seven-year WB contract. Within months, they were wooed away by Sony Corporation, which offered Guber and Peters one billion dollars to assume chief executive posts.  Peters left to start Peters Entertainment which has produced such blockbusters as Batman Returns, Wild Wild West, Ali, and Superman Returns. Peters has received over 254 nominations, and won multiple Oscars, Golden Globes, and Grammys. The producer&apos;s combined grosses exceed $6 Billion worldwide and will continue to soar with two Superman sequels and a Star is Born remake in development. Peters is the proud father of five children: Christopher, Caleigh, Jordan, Skye, and Kendyl. Through the Peters Family Foundation he supports the Christopher Reeve Foundation, Life Rolls On, Homeboy Industries, My Friend&apos;s Place, Cambodian Children&apos;s Fund, Andre Sobel River of Life Foundation, Heartfelt Foundation, The Laurence School, the Sheriff&apos;s Youth Foundation, and countless other youth charities.</biography>

      <biography>After leaving school, Richard joined the ABC in Sydney with hopes of emulating his father, Jack Bruce, who worked as a cinematographer in Hollywood for Cecil B. De Mille and the Famous Lansky Players. However, the only opening at the time was in editing. He fell in love with the craft and spent 15 years with the ABC working on various current affairs and other programs before getting into drama. He left the ABC to work on the feature &quot;Goodbye Paradise&quot; before going on to &quot;Careful He Might Hear You&quot; and Kennedy Miller&apos;s &quot;The Dismissal&quot; and &quot;Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome&quot;. It was through George Miller&apos;s studio film &quot;The Witches of Eastwick that Richard was introduced to Hollywood. He again worked for Miller on his 1992 film &quot;Lorenzo&apos;s Oil&quot;. Richard got the job on &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; over 30 of Hollywood&apos;s best editors because the producer had a similar background (at the BBC) and took a liking to him. In June/July 1996 Richard visited Australia for the first time in four years and during that time spoke at a seminar at the Australian Film Television and Radio School entitled Frame By Frame, where he took the audience cut by cut through every aspect of the production of &quot;Seven&quot;. He was also interviewed for the ABC- TV program &quot;Review&quot;. Richard was also nominated for the Eddies (American Cinema Editor&apos;s Awards) for his work on &quot;Shawshank&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot; and in 1997 Richard was invited to become a member of the American Cinema Editors. In 1998 he received his third Oscar nomination for his work on &quot;Air Force One&quot;, a fact which attracted considerable attention by the Australian TV and press. However, although it was hoped he would be third time lucky, the Oscar went to the blockbuster of the year Titanic. In 2001 he was again nominated by the Americian Cinema Editor&apos;s for his work on &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone .</biography>

      <birthName>Conn, Catherine</birthName>
      <biography>Kitty Carlisle Hart wore a cloak of many professional and elegant colors. Actress, opera singer, Broadway performer, TV celebrity, game show panelist, patron of the arts, and, at age 95, this vital woman continued her six-decade musical odyssey with songs and reminisces in her one-woman show: &quot;Kitty Carlisle Hart: An American Icon,&quot; which toured from her beloved New York to Los Angeles. She developed pneumonia soon after her tour folded toward the end of 2006 and passed away of congestive heart failure in April of 2007.  The New Orleans-born Carlisle Hart was born on September 3, 1910, and baptized Catherine Conn (pronounced Cohen), her family being of German Jewish ancestry. Her father, Dr. Joseph Conn, was a gynecologist who died when she was only ten. Her very ambitious mother, Hortense, escorted Kitty to Europe in 1921 with the intentions of marrying her off &apos;Grace Kelly (I)&apos; (qv) style into European royalty. When that plan didn&apos;t pan out, they stayed in Europe where Kitty received her adult education in Switzerland, London, Paris and Rome. She finally zeroed in on her acting career after being accepted into London&apos;s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and also went on to train at the Theatre de l&apos;Atelier in Paris.  She and her mother eventually returned to New York in 1932 wherein she first apprenticed with the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. She attracted notice quite early in her career. Billed as Kitty Carlisle, she found radio work and made her first appearance on the musical stage in the title role of &quot;Rio Rita.&quot; The legitimately-trained singer went on to appear in a number of operettas, including 1933&apos;s &quot;Champagne Sec&quot; (as Prince Orlofsky), as well as the musical comedies &quot;White Horse Inn&quot; (1936) and &quot;Three Waltzes&quot; (1937).  Her early ingénue movie career included warbling in the musical mystery _Murder at the Vanities (1934)_ (qv), and alongside &apos;Allan Jones (I)&apos; (qv) amidst the zany goings-on of the Marx Brothers in the classic farce _A Night at the Opera (1935)_ (qv). She also played a love interest to &apos;Bing Crosby&apos; (qv)&apos;s in two of his lesser known musical outings _Here Is My Heart (1934)_ (qv) and _She Loves Me Not (1934)_ (qv).  Films were not her strong suit, however, and she returned to her theatre roots. Appearing in her first dramatic productions &quot;French Without Tears&quot; and &quot;The Night of January 16th&quot; in 1938, she went on to grace a number of chic and stylish plays and musicals throughout the 40s, including &quot;Walk with Music (1940), &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1943, &quot;Design for Living (1943) and &quot;There&apos;s Always Juliet&quot; (1944). She subsequently performed in &apos;Benjamin Britten&apos; (qv)&apos;s 1948 American premiere of &quot;The Rape of Lucretia.&quot; In 1946, she married Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright &apos;Moss Hart&apos; (qv) and appeared in a number of his works including his classic &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1949) and the witty Broadway comedy &quot;Anniversary Waltz&quot; (1954). The couple had two children. He died in 1961 and she never remarried, spending much of her existing time keeping his name alive to future generations.  It was the small screen that would make Kitty a welcome household commodity. The steadfast panelist of several quiz shows in the 1950s, it was the popular game show _&quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; (1956)_ (qv) that anointed her game show doyenne and icon. A regular panelist for some 20 years, she appeared on each and every revamped format from its 1956 inception to its 2002 syndicated version. Known for her stately presence, infectious laugh, pouffy dark Prince Valiant hairstyle, and sweeping couture gowns on the show, audiences reveled at her effortless class to these simple parlor games. She also was a substitute panelist for other popular game shows such as &quot;What&apos;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ve Got a Secret.&quot;  In later years, she became an important society maven of New York City, an avid patron and zealous supporter of the performing arts. Appointed to various state-wide councils, she was chairman of the New York State Council of the Arts in 1976 and served in that capacity for 20 years, also serving on the boards of various New York City cultural institutions. A noted lecturer, the civic-minded Carlisle Hart was active in administrative capacities as well, notably as Chairman of Governor Rockefeller&apos;s Conference on Woman (1966) and as special consultant to the Governor on women&apos;s opportunities. At one time she wrote the column &quot;Kitty&apos;s Calendar&quot; for Women&apos;s Unit News.  Kitty never stopped entertaining. Making her Metropolitan debut on New Year&apos;s Eve 1966 as Prince Orlovsky in &quot;Die Fledermaus,&quot; she joined the touring production the following year. She appeared in concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra and appeared with the Boston Opera Company at one point. She added stature to a number of summer stock plays including &quot;Kiss Me Kate,&quot; &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; and her husband&apos;s &quot;Light Up the Sky.&quot; Returning to Broadway as a replacement for &apos;Dina Merrill&apos; (qv) in the 1983 revival of &quot;On Your Toes,&quot; she was later spotted in &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Radio Days (1987)_ (qv) and _Six Degrees of Separation (1993)_ (qv).  Carlisle penned her autobiography, Kitty, in 1984.</biography>

      <birthName>Wopat, Thomas S.</birthName>
      <biography>He&apos;ll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol&apos; boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed, dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking &apos;John Schneider (I)&apos; (qv) was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s series _&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows.  The highly engaging Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951. Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.  Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;, other book shows came his way including &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; and the lead in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn&apos;t take long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons, although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn&apos;t the same without them and they eventually were brought back. During the show&apos;s run, Tom kick-started his recording career with his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.  After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as &apos;Cybill Shepherd&apos; (qv)&apos; ex-husband/stuntman on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills. He returned with commanding baritone leads in &quot;Carousel&quot; (1986), &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1990) and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting Frank Butler role opposite &apos;Bernadette Peters&apos; (qv) in the popular Broadway revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and earned a Tony nomination in the process.  It&apos;s only gotten sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras in programs featuring Broadway&apos;s finest music, he has continued on the New York stage with successive roles in &quot;42nd Street&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn). In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for &quot;Best Revival of a Play&quot;) production of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; starring acting heavyweights &apos;Alan Alda&apos; (qv) and &apos;Liev Schreiber&apos; (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; tour with &apos;Faith Prince&apos; (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of &apos;Harold Arlen&apos; (qv), a tour that included Carnegie Hall.</biography>

      <birthName>Strathairn, David Russell</birthName>
      <biography>David Strathairn was born on January 26, 1949 in San Francisco, California. His father was a physician and he has two siblings, a brother Tom and a sister named Anne. He attended Williams College, where he demonstrated great interest in the theater, and first befriended &apos;John Sayles (I)&apos; (qv), with whom he would later frequently collaborate. Strathairn graduated college and traveled to Florida to visit with his grandfather, but the grandfather passed away while Strathairn was en route. Strathairn, finding himself freshly-arrived and without friends in Florida, decided instead to join the Ringling Brothers Clown College and subsequently worked as a clown for six months in a traveling circus.  Relocating to New York State, he spent several years hitchhiking across America to work in local theaters during the summers. During one of these summers Strathairn reunited with Sayles, and this eventually resulted in his role in the highly regarded _Return of the Secaucus Seven (1979)_ (qv), Sayle&apos;s directorial debut. Thereafter Strathairn developed an extensive resume of supporting roles, which became increasingly substantial as his stature in the industry grew; notable films include _Lovesick (1983)_ (qv), _Silkwood (1983)_ (qv), _L.A. Confidential (1997)_ (qv), and _A Map of the World (1999)_ (qv). Sayles frequently casts Strathairn, whose performances can be seen in Sayles&apos; _The Brother from Another Planet (1984)_ (qv), _Matewan (1987)_ (qv), _Eight Men Out (1988)_ (qv), _City of Hope (1991)_ (qv), and _Passion Fish (1992)_ (qv). Perhaps most notable of his collaborations with Sayles is his superb performance co-starring with &apos;Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio&apos; (qv) in _Limbo (1999)_ (qv).  After a string of successful supporting roles in the early 2000s, Strathairn found himself thrust into the role of leading man with his performance as &apos;Edward R. Murrow&apos; (qv) in &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005)_ (qv) Taking on the role of the iconic newsman in the black-and-white drama, Strathairn garnered numerous award mentions including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Following the success of that film, Strathairn traveled easily between low-budget independent films - _The Notorious Bettie Page (2005)_ (qv), _The Sensation of Sight (2006)_ (qv), _My Blueberry Nights (2007)_ (qv), and _Howl (2010)_ (qv) among them - and big-budget Hollywood productions, including _We Are Marshall (2006)_ (qv), _The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008)_ (qv), both _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Legacy (2012)_ (qv), and &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s biopic _Lincoln (2012)_ (qv), in which he plays Secretary of State William Seward.  Strathairn has also worked extensively in television, and first became familiar to television viewers as the title character&apos;s boss in the series _&quot;The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd&quot; (1987)_ (qv). In addition to narration work for many PBS shows, Strathairn has appeared in the TV series _&quot;Big Apple&quot; (2001)_ (qv), _&quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999)_ (qv), _&quot;Monk&quot; (2002)_ (qv), and heads the cast of the science-fiction series _&quot;Alphas&quot; (2011)_ (qv). His work in television films has brought him an Emmy Award for _Temple Grandin (2010) (TV)_ (qv) and an Emmy nominations for _Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn (2012) (TV)_ (qv).  Strathairn married &apos;Logan Freeman&apos; (qv) in 1980, and the couple have two children.</biography>

      <birthName>DiCaprio, Leonardo Wilhelm</birthName>
      <biography>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv) and &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv). But such a rich, varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring as DiCaprio.  Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist &apos;George DiCaprio (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Irmelin DiCaprio&apos; (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo&apos;s father, George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late &apos;Harvey Pekar&apos;, a friend of George&apos;s. However, Leonardo&apos;s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name &quot;Lenny Williams&quot;, DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as _&quot;Roseanne&quot; (1988)_ (qv) and _&quot;The New Lassie&quot; (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn&apos;t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie.  While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio&apos;s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the &quot;Cousin Oliver&quot; role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio&apos;s stint on _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public&apos;s attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What&apos;s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, &quot;Jim Carroll&quot;, in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late &apos;River Phoenix&apos; (qv) originally expressed interest in.  While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo&apos;s reputation as an actor, it wasn&apos;t until his role as &quot;Romeo&quot; in &apos;Baz Luhrmann&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio&apos;s reputation as a teen heartthrob.  Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv).  With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment.  As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring and challenging actors working today.</biography>

      <birthName>Cleese, John Marwood</birthName>
      <biography>John Cleese was born on October 27, 1939, in Weston-Super-Mare, England. He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, &quot;The Goon Show,&quot; starring the legendary &apos;Peter Sellers (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Spike Milligan&apos; (qv), and &apos;Harry Secombe&apos; (qv).  Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university&apos;s legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python &apos;Graham Chapman&apos; (qv). Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name &quot;Cambridge Circus.&quot; When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv), another future Python.  Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, &quot;I&apos;m Sorry, I&apos;ll Read That Again&quot;, based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies &apos;Tim Brooke-Taylor&apos; (qv), &apos;Bill Oddie&apos; (qv) and &apos;Graeme Garden&apos; (qv). He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, &apos;Graham Chapman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Marty Feldman&apos; (qv) in _&quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; (1967)_ (qv), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - &apos;Eric Idle&apos; (qv), &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv), &apos;Terry Jones (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Michael Palin&apos; (qv), and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included _&quot;The Frost Report&quot; (1966)_ (qv) and &apos;Marty Feldman&apos; (qv)&apos;s program _&quot;Marty&quot; (1968)_ (qv). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, _&quot;Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969)_ (qv), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day.  After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - _Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)_ (qv), _Life of Brian (1979)_ (qv), _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982)_ (qv), and _The Meaning of Life (1983)_ (qv). Cleese and then-wife &apos;Connie Booth (I)&apos; (qv) collaborated in the legendary television series _&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975)_ (qv), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.  Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy _A Fish Called Wanda (1988)_ (qv), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials.  Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese&apos;s other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with &apos;Connie Booth (I)&apos; (qv) and a daughter with his second wife, &apos;Barbara Trentham&apos; (qv). As of January 19, 2008, he became embroiled in divorce proceedings with third wife (of nineteen years) &apos;Alyce Faye Eichelberger&apos; (qv).  Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.</biography>

      <biography>Jeffrey Pritz was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan the son of a Ford Motor blue collar. With his solid story sense, deep producing craft and a nose for the audience, he represents the latest crop of young Hollywood producer/directors to hail from the late &apos;Samuel Z. Arkoff&apos; (qv) camp. The big boss man of American International Pictures which was an early practice ground for young producer/directors such as &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv), &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv), &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv), &apos;Ivan Reitman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Brian De Palma&apos; (qv). Having worked with the late Samuel Z. Arkoff and his son &apos;Lou Arkoff&apos; (qv), he learned first hand from one of the industry&apos;s legendary producers. Empowering him with 5 decades of film making savvy. Upon completing five feature films with &apos;Stan Winston&apos; (qv) and the Arkoffs, he was given the opportunity to experience work with other producers and directors such as &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) and &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv).  In 2006 while working with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives writing television pilot &quot;The Fifth&quot; he suddenly and without warning lost his eyesight due to an auto immune disorder. He returned to his home state of Michigan to receive medical treatment in an effort to regain his vision. After an eight month battle he regained his ability to see. Since 2008 he&apos;s been working heavily in technology with individuals such as Dr. Srinidhi Varadarajan of Virginia Tech University who built the worlds third fastest supercomputer in 2004 using all Mac computers. The two designed a supercomputing facility in Boise Idaho that was to trans-code high-definition for the film and television industry video using a clustered computing environment. Much like the Systems X supercomputer Varadarajan built for VT.  As of January 2010 he&apos;s been working with the The Julie Love Foundation JLF designing another data center to be used as a catalyst for the foundations efforts and its online transparency. He&apos;s also formed a company with seventeen year old Koen Van Urk out of the Netherlands called eHlloo! App&apos;s (pronounced like Hello) that builds mobile applications for the iPhone and the soon to be released iPad from Apple Computers.</biography>

      <biography>Born on an island, in the harbor city of Nanaimo, B.C., today Crowe&apos;s reach is global. From a home computer on the Gulf Islands to a state ceremony in Tasmania - the audience for her songs and music videos numbers more millions each year.  Courted by the establishment, Crowe, taking a cue from Ani DiFranco and Loreena McKennitt, chose instead to form her own label. Since 2001, Rubenesque Records Ltd. has released a series of critically and commercially successful recordings: Lisa&apos;s Song+ 6 Songs (2001-3); Secrets (2004); Tidings (2004); Live at Wood Hall (2005); This Little Bird (2006); Little Light (2008); Spiral (2010); Arthur / Up to the Mountain (2011); Tidings Concert (2012); Newfoundland Vinyl (2013); Heavy Graces (2013); and Songbook (2013/14).  Broadcast highlights include a pair of one-hour television specials: &quot;Allison Crowe: Inside Pandora&apos;s Box&quot; and &quot;Tidings&quot; (airing nationally across Canada from 2002 - 2008). Allison Crowe appears in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013) - an epic science fiction movie adventure featuring Superman. In this blockbuster film, Crowe cameos as a singer/musician in Cassidy&apos;s Bar where Clark Kent is working incognito. She performs &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, a song penned by June Carter and Merle Kilgore and made legendary by &apos;The Man in Black&apos;. &quot;I&apos;m a big Johnny Cash fan. And I&apos;m a big Allison Crowe fan. So the combination to me seemed like an awesome opportunity if we could make it happen,&quot; explains &quot;Man of Steel&quot; Director Zack Snyder.  Allison Crowe has performed as concert headliner on hundreds of occasions, in a dozen countries - from solo gigs in jazz caverns and grand churches, to the concert festival stage alongside the Queen&apos;s Master of Music, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, and Britain&apos;s Poet Laureate, Carol Ann Duffy. In 2012, Allison Crowe performed live on-stage with Canada&apos;s Royal Winnipeg Ballet for the World Premiere of &quot;The Doorway - Scenes from Leonard Cohen&quot; - created and choreographed by Jorden Morris with artistic direction from the RWB&apos;s André Lewis.  Vocalist, pianist, guitarist, songwriter, engineer, producer and arranger, Allison Crowe, born on an island in the Pacific now lives on another - on Canada&apos;s Atlantic coast, in Corner Brook, Newfoundland. From her home-base she records and tours steadily, giving legendary performances that stir together original songs with much-loved interpretations in an organic blend of rock, jazz, folk, Broadway, gospel and soul.</biography>

      <biography>Jacqueline Lovell was born and raised in Southern California. From a very young age, she had the immense innate talent and enthusiasm for performance. She expressed this through school musicals and church plays from grade school through high school. In much of her free time, she was writing skits and performing them for her family. She attended many schools during her formative years, which instilled drive and independence in her. At eighteen, she went to Santa Monica College to pursue accounting and later landed a full time job as an accountant.  However, she quickly realized her hunger was not being fulfilled. So she set sail and journeyed into the world of modeling. She quickly became the number one nude model in 1995 and was in over 150 magazines by &apos;96. She completed more than 80 videos for Playboy, Penthouse and numerous independents. Not only beautiful but also intelligent, she became the publisher for &quot;Babe&quot; Magazine. She also wrote for &quot;Femme Fatales&quot; Magazine and for major internet corporations such as Danni Ash&apos;s Harddrive. After being in the industry for one year, Jacqueline&apos;s desire to grow as a person led her to acting classes. As she studied her craft, her vocation became clear. She started as an extra in Forest Gump, The Truth about Cats and Dogs, Murder She Wrote, Baywatch Nights and before long her talent was recognized. She was cast in lead roles for Full Moon Entertainment, Zalman King Productions, Mystique Films, and many more.  Jacqueline has acted in films around the world planting her seed in film history. She has easily become one of the top erotic actresses in Hollywood. Others with as much success in erotic films might be content to focus only on that genre. But not someone with Jacqueline&apos;s talent. She has closed this chapter in her life to focus on mainstream roles.</biography>

      <biography>The oldest of three brothers and three sisters, Paul Warren was born in Hillingdon, Middlesex, England in 1974.  After leaving school with qualifications in drama, art and music, he formed the post-punk rock band &apos;Monkey Boy&apos; with his brother, Mark. A minimalist trio from London, consisting of just two bass players and Paul the singing, front-man drummer, they generated a massive buzz on the underground punk rock scene.  Lockjaw Records signed the band in 1998 and immediately sent them out touring Europe, where they built a formidable following and critical acclaim from the likes of John Peel, Kerrang!, Metal Hammer, Rocksound and Melody Maker.  In 2005, after releasing 2 albums and multiple EP&apos;s, the band went on an indefinite hiatus and Paul set about pursuing work in the film industry.  After a stint of walk-on/featured roles in various films/tv shows, and a body double for Daniel Radcliffe on Harry Potter &amp; the Order of the Phoenix, he was offered work with the legendary Stan Winston Studios on &apos;The Deaths of Ian Stone&apos; which would utilise his thin frame and physical attributes. A door opening into the world of performing in prosthetics, it ultimately led to a film career playing creatures and characters in silicone/foam latex.  Although known mostly now for his performances under heavy prosthetic makeup, he had a regular role on CBBC&apos;s Sorry I&apos;ve Got No Head and was one of the visual fx doubles for skinny Steve Rogers a.k.a Captain America: The First Avenger.  Paul is a highly sort after actor/creature performer, having worked closely with some of the movie industry&apos;s leading visual and makeup effects supervisors, Shane Mahan (Terminator, Aliens), Conor O&apos;Sullivan (The Dark Knight), Christopher Townsend (Industrial Light &amp; Magic), Mark Coulier (Harry Potter), Kristyan Mallett (Dark Shadows) and David White (Thor: The Dark World), on such films as Clash/Wrath of the Titans, World War Z, the upcoming sci-fi thriller Last Days on Mars, and Thor: The Dark World.</biography>

      <birthName>Jr., Charles Pete Rose</birthName>
      <biography>The elegant, handsome, fiercely intelligent and inquisitive host of the self-titled _&quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; (1991)_ (qv), Charlie Rose was the only child of Charles Peete Rose Sr. and Margaret Rose. Born Charles Peete Rose Jr. on January 5, 1942 (Capricorn) in Henderson, North Carolina. The Rose family lived near the railroad tracks in Henderson, in rooms above the general store that Charles Rose Sr. owned and managed and where Charlie Jr. helped out. After graduating from high school, where he starred on the basketball team, Rose entered Duke University as a pre-med student. His extra-curricular activities included working with children in a Head Start program. One summer, he secured an internship in the office of North Carolina senator B. Everett Jordan. According to him, his experiences as an intern turned him into a &quot;political junkie&quot; and, upon returning to college, he changed his major to history. After receiving an A.B. degree in 1964, he entered the Duke University School of Law but, sometime before or shortly after earning a J.D. degree in 1968, he realised that the practice of law held little interest for him. Inspired by the idea of &quot;building something&quot; as an entrepreneur, he started taking classes at the New York University Graduate School of Business (he had moved to New York City in 1968) and accepted a job at Bankers Trust. Through his wife, who was doing research for the CBS television show _&quot;60 Minutes&quot; (1968)_ (qv), Rose became friendly with people employed in broadcasting and he developed what soon became a passionate interest in the broadcast media. After his wife was hired by the BBC in the United States, he handled some assignments for the BBC on a freelance basis. In 1972, while continuing to work at Bankers Trust, he landed a job as a weekend reporter for WPIX-TV, in New York City. During his approximately one-year stint at WPIX, Rose tried several times, without success, to contact &apos;Bill Moyers&apos; (qv) for an interview. Then, in 1974, Moyers telephoned Rose, after Rose&apos;s wife spoke to Moyers about him at a social gathering. At their first meeting, he and Moyers felt an &quot;instant chemistry&quot; and, within weeks, he began working as the managing editor of the PBS series &quot;Bill Moyers&apos; International Report&quot;). (Moyers has said that Rose served as his &quot;alter ego&quot; as well at that time.) In 1975, Moyers named him the executive producer of _&quot;Bill Moyers&apos; Journal&quot; (1972)_ (qv), a PBS documentary and conversation series although, by his own account, Rose had &quot;no great desire to be on camera&quot;. In the following year, he became the correspondent for U.S.A.: People and Politics, Moyers&apos;s new weekly PBS political magazine series. &quot;A Conversation with Jimmy Carter&quot;, one installment of that series, won a 1976 Peabody Award. Later in 1976, after Moyers left public television to work for CBS, Rose accepted a Washington, D.C.-based job as a political correspondent for NBC News. In the belief that he lacked sufficient training to do a proper job and that he should &quot;get the maximum amount of on-air experience&quot;, as he put it, he seized opportunities to host interview shows. He first appeared as a guest host on &quot;Panorama&quot;, on WTTG-TV, in Washington, D.C. In 1978, after leaving NBC, he served as a co-host with AM/Chicago, on WLS-TV. A year later, Blake Byrne, the general manager of KXAS-TV in Dallas-Fort Worth, hired him as programme manager and, although the station had no budget to pay Rose to do a talk show, he also offered him a time slot for what became _&quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; (1991)_ (qv). In 1981, with the goal of securing national syndication, Rose moved _&quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; (1991)_ (qv) to Washington, D.C. where, for the next two years or so, it was broadcast on the NBC-owned station WRC-TV. Concurrently, he hosted another weekly interview show for WRC-TV. At the end of 1983, CBS hired Rose to anchor _&quot;CBS News Nightwatch&quot; (1982)_ (qv), an interview program that was taped during the day and was broadcast five times a week between 2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. Rose has recalled having &quot;a wonderful time&quot; during his six-and-a-half years as the CBS News Nightwatch host. Like that of Charlie Rose, the CBS News Nightwatch guest list was not confined to the world&apos;s movers and shakers. Among the other people whose activities or histories caught Rose&apos;s interest was the convicted murderer &apos;Charles Manson&apos; (qv), with whom he talked for three hours. The CBS News Nightwatch broadcast of Rose&apos;s interview with Manson won an Emmy Award in 1987. In 1990, Rose left CBS to serve as anchor of &quot;Personalities&quot;, a syndicated programme produced by Fox Television. Angry to find himself hosting a tabloid-like news show, he broke his contract after just six weeks. About ten months later, he approached PBS-affiliated station Thirteen/WNET-TV in New York City, with a proposal for a new interview show. Charlie Rose premiered on Thirteen/WNET on September 30, 1991. During nine months in 1992, it also on the Learning Channel. Syndicated nationally since January 1993, it currently airs on 215 PBS affiliate stations. The show&apos;s premise is simple; engage the best politicians, thinkers, personalities, celebrities, sports figures, artists, writers and scientists in one-on-one conversation without any gimmicks and irritating commercial breaks. The show&apos;s simple black background and round oak table serve to do just that, along with Rose&apos;s intelligent interviewing style and ability to ask pertinent questions, forcing the essence of the personalities to come out. Rose has interviewed the likes of President &apos;Nelson Mandela&apos; (qv), President &apos;Bill Clinton (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Salman Rushdie&apos; (qv), &apos;Madonna&apos; (qv), &apos;Bono&apos; (qv) of &apos;U2&apos; (qv), &apos;Bill Gates (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Meryl Streep&apos; (qv), &apos;Warren Beatty (I)&apos; (qv) and countless others. According to a conversation he had with &apos;Chuck D. (I)&apos; (qv) of &apos;Public Enemy&apos; (qv) fame, he has conducted over 100,000 interviews. Divorced, Rose splits his time between a rented townhouse in Manhattan (that, according to him, is filled with an &quot;embarrassing amount&quot; of electronic equipment) and Bellport, Long Island. On weekends, when not enjoying the rich, cultural life of New York City or preparing for his show, he travels to his farm near Oxford, North Carolina or to the upstate New York farm of a friend.</biography>

      <biography>A talented character actor known for his military roles, Ronald Lee Ermey was in the United States Marine Corps for 11 years. He rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant, and later was bestowed the honorary rank of Gunnery Sergeant by the Marine Corps, after he served 14 months in Vietnam and later did two tours in Okinawa, Japan. After injuries forced him to retire from the Corps, he moved to the Phillipines, enrolling in the University of Manila, where he studied Criminology and Drama. He appeared in several Filipino films before being cast as a helicopter pilot in &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Apocalypse Now (1979)_ (qv). Due to his Vietnam experiences, Coppola also utilized him as a technical adviser. He got a featured role in &apos;Sidney J. Furie&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Boys in Company C (1978)_ (qv), playing a drill instructor. Ermey worked with Furie again in _Purple Hearts (1984)_ (qv).  However, his most famous (or infamous) role came as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in &apos;Stanley Kubrick&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Full Metal Jacket (1987)_ (qv), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. He did win the best supporting actor award from The Boston Society of Film Critics. Since then, he has appeared in numerous character roles in such films as _Leaving Las Vegas (1995)_ (qv), _Se7en (1995)_ (qv) and _Dead Man Walking (1995)_ (qv). However, Ermey prefers comedy to drama, and has a comedic role in _Saving Silverman (2001)_ (qv). Ronald Lee Ermey continues to be one of the best character actors in the business, and you can bet that when his name appears in a movie&apos;s credits, he is going to be top notch in his role.</biography>

      <biography>Javier Bardem is the youngest member of a family of actors that has been making films since the early days of Spanish cinema. He got his start in the family business, at age six, when he appeared in his first feature, &quot;El picaro&quot; (1974) (A.K.A. The Scoundrel). During his teenage years, he acted in several TV series, played rugby for the Spanish National Team, and toured the country with an independent theatrical group. Javier&apos;s early film role as a sexy stud in the black comedy, _Jamón Jamón (1992)_ (qv) (aka Ham Ham) propelled him to instant popularity and threatened to typecast him as nothing more than a brawny sex symbol. Determined to avert a beefcake image, he refused similar subsequent roles and has gone on to win acclaim for his ability to appear almost unrecognizable from film to film. With over 25 movies and numerous awards under his belt, it is Javier&apos;s stirring, passionate performance as the persecuted Cuban writer, &apos;Reynaldo Arenas (I)&apos; (qv), in _Before Night Falls (2000)_ (qv) that will long be remembered as his breakthrough role. He received five Best Actor awards and a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal.</biography>

His father was an officer at the D-Day landings in Normandy, and after the war he was summoned to Buckingham Palace where he received the Distinguished Service Cross medal from King George VI in person. After graduating from the University of Salford in England with a Bachelors degree, Paul took a trip to California. He liked it so much that he stayed. He applied to be an officer in the U.S Marines and passed all the tests except for the one for his eyesight. Very disappointed, he moved on to other things, including acting. Because of his military look and hair style (high &apos;n&apos; tight) he has been cast in many military roles as a background actor, most recently as a 4-star U.S. Air Force General in a Disney Production. He recently graduated with a Masters degree in Communication from Hawaii Pacific University and can now concentrate on gaining more acting work.</biography>

      <birthName>Caan, Scott Andrew</birthName>
      <biography>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a &quot;man&apos;s-man&quot; like his father, legendary actor &apos;James Caan (I)&apos; (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sean Penn (I)&apos; (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent&apos;s homes. His mom is actress and model &apos;Sheila Ryan (II)&apos; (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father&apos;s hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son&apos;s little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend &apos;The Alchemist&apos; (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and &apos;Gregg Araki&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director &apos;Tony Scott (I)&apos; (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott&apos;s star rose with a fun supporting turn in &apos;Steven Soderbergh&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - &apos;Nicolas Cage&apos; (qv)&apos;s directorial debut starring &apos;James Franco&apos; (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in &apos;Nicole Holofcener&apos; (qv)&apos;s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan&apos;s return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _&quot;Entourage&quot; (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _&quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer &apos;Phil Parmet&apos; (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biography>

      <biography>Marco Flammer was born in Benoni, a city in the greater Johannesburg-area, South Africa on December 12th, 1979. His mother and father, Renate and Eduard Flammer are both German and immigrated in the late 60&apos;s to South Africa from Frankfurt and Tubingen which was then known as the former West Germany. His home language was German while his second and third languages were English, Afrikaans and Xhosa. Originally Marco&apos;s education and vocation was as a civil engineering as a result of his father wishes to have one son to succeed him in the family construction business. He started his tertiary education in 1998 in Pretoria, South Africa at the Tshwane University of Technology and later received a bursary through a university in Groningen in Nederland. He completed his Dutch bachelor&apos;s degree in 2003 in International Civil Engineering Project Management and returned to South Africa to work as a civil engineer in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Secunda and the Eastern Cape while completing a second bachelor&apos;s degree part time in Transportation in 2006. During 2004 and 2006 he also completed a Diploma and started a Degree in Theology with the emphasis on Christian Counselling with the aim to better understand the emotional needs and psychology of other individuals. Marco was determined to work within the arts since a very young age as a result of the influence and inspiration his mother had on him (his mom a gifted artist and teacher). During his childhood his involvement in art was through the media of painting, photography, literature and performing arts in and outside of school hours. He originally dreamed of becoming a graphic designer and fine painting artist to express his creative gift on canvas but never found the time with his demanding career and studies. Soon after the completion of his decorous education in science in 2006 he decided to move to London in March of 2007 in the aim of developing his creative aptitude. At first the grapple to survive and remain in London anchored him firmly to his existing civil engineering vocation and science until he finally reached solidity which allowed him freedom to explore a part time career in acting and photography as a model. His first mini-role was in 2010 when he was cast as a double for Albert Ball (Vincent Regan) in the British film St Georges Day.</biography>

      <biography>He&apos;s the son of Vaudeville great, &apos;Clarence Stroud&apos; (qv), of the Stroud Twins and singer &apos;Ann McCormack (I)&apos; (qv), who toured the world with &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv).  Don grew up on the beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, where his stepfather, &apos;Paul Livermore&apos; (qv), and his mother, Ann, owned and operated the popular &quot;Embers Steak House&quot; and nightclub where Ann performed nightly. Don thrived on the beach in Waikiki under the watchful eyes of such mentors as Blackout, Mud, Buckshot, Rabbit and Steamboat. He learned much from these famous beach boys and in 1960, at the age of 17, he placed fourth in the &quot;Duke Kahanamoku World Surfing Championship&quot; at Makaha, Hawaii. Don was surfing at Waikiki when he was discovered. Actor &apos;Troy Donahue&apos; (qv) was filming _&quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; (1959)_ (qv) and needed a stunt double for his surfing scenes. Don, at 18, 6&apos; 2&quot; and 175 pounds, stepped up and was hired on the spot. He loved the gig so much, he decided to go to Hollywood to give it a try. Upon arriving in L.A., he landed a variety of jobs, including parking cars, bouncer and then manager of the world famous &quot;Whiskey A Go-Go&quot; nightclub on the Sunset Strip, where such greats as &apos;Janis Joplin&apos; (qv), &apos;Jimi Hendrix&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jim Morrison (I)&apos; (qv) of the &quot;Doors&quot; appeared. It was at the &quot;Whiskey&quot; that actor &apos;Sidney Poitier&apos; (qv) turned Don on to his acting career. Don went on to become one of Hollywood&apos;s great heavies and character actors. He has starred in over 100 movies and 175 television shows to date. He has also starred in four television series, notably &apos;Mickey Spillane&apos; (qv)&apos;s _&quot;Mike Hammer&quot; (1984)_ (qv) with &apos;Stacy Keach&apos; (qv) and _&quot;The New Gidget&quot; (1986)_ (qv) where he was a natural to play the &quot;Kahuna&quot;.</biography>

      <birthName>McKellen, Ian Murray</birthName>
      <biography>Ian Murray McKellen was born on May 25, 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, England. His parents, Denis and Margery, soon moved with Ian and his sister Jean to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theater, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by &apos;William Shakespeare (I)&apos; (qv), in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian&apos;s growing passion for theatre. When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theater festivals, where he saw the greats perform: &apos;Laurence Olivier&apos; (qv), &apos;Wendy Hiller (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;John Gielgud&apos; (qv), &apos;Ralph Richardson (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Paul Robeson&apos; (qv). He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest. McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian&apos;s homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing &apos;Margaret Thatcher (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;section 28&quot; legislation which would make the &quot;public promotion of homosexuality&quot; a crime. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand, and he has been active in the Gay Rights movement ever since.  Ian currently resides in Limehouse, where he lives with his current lover of 8 years, &apos;Sean Mathias&apos; (qv). The two worked together on the film _Bent (1997)_ (qv). To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by &apos;Queen Elizabeth II&apos; (qv) in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare&apos;s works including his well received _Richard III (1995)_ (qv), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, _Cold Comfort Farm (1995) (TV)_ (qv), _Apt Pupil (1998)_ (qv) and _Gods and Monsters (1998)_ (qv), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen&apos;s role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen continues to work extensively on stage... solidifying his role as &apos;Laurence Olivier&apos; (qv)&apos;s worthy successor, having recently scored hits in the London productions of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &apos;Noel Coward&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Present Laughter&quot;.</biography>

      <biography>Born in Nutley, NJ, Nick Zano&apos;s passion for the movies began when he first watched _Goodfellas (1990)_ (qv) at the age of 12. He had long dreamed of becoming a Navy Seal, but all that changed in one afternoon at the cinema. Shortly after that, Zano and his family moved south to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he finished his high school education. Throughout his high school years, he was active in both the drama and TV production departments. In his junior year, Zano and his closest friends produced a weekly television program at Wellington High School. The wildly humorous and offbeat skit comedy show landed Zano in detention quite often, where he would kill time by writing a series of short films. Those shorts, which he starred in and helped to direct, made their way to the JVC Universal Film Competition semifinals 3 years in a row.  Shortly after high school, he was offered a position with &quot;Prelude Pictures&quot; (_Lost in Space (1998)_ (qv), _Black Dog (1998)_ (qv)) in Television and Feature Film Development. During that time, he also acted as Associate Producer on the World AIDS Day TV special, Living Positive, hosted by &apos;Lou Diamond Phillips&apos; (qv). In June 2001, Zano made the move to LA, where he began the daily grind of auditioning. His quick wit and charming sense of humor immediately made him a favorite among casting directors, who would call him in for reads even when the character description was totally opposite to his looks. Zano has a mental Rolodex overflowing with movie knowledge, which helped him land the hosting gig on MTV&apos;s _&quot;Movie House&quot; (2002)_ (qv), which premiered on the cable channel in May 2002. After his move to LA, Zano remained close with his sisters and his Mom, who always supported and inspired him. Zano resides in Los Angeles.</biography>

Oprah Gail Winfrey was the richest African American of the 20th century, however Orpah Gail Winfrey wasn&apos;t born into a rich, or even middle class family. Orpah Gail Winfrey was born in an economically troubled neighborhood and raised by a single-teenaged mother in the city of Milwaukee. Orpah, named after a biblical character, had a name no one could pronounce, so her family and friends starting calling her Oprah. Shortly after Oprah&apos;s birth, Vernita Lee left her daughter and traveled north. Oprah was then raised by her grandmother,Hatti Mae Lee. Oprah while being raised by her grandmother lived in terrible conditions. Oprah&apos;s only friends were farm animals,however even at that age Oprah had a very imaginative mind. Oprah would frequently give the animals dramatic parts and included them in games.

      <biography>Actor Dennis Farina is unique among thespians in that he was one of the few to achieve success as a &quot;late-bloomer.&quot; He did not start acting until he was 37 years old, after stints in the military and 18 years on the Chicago Police Department. He made his bones in show business as a character actor, often cast as a cop or gangster. Though often cast as heavies, Farina was also adept at comedy roles.  A leap year baby born on February 29, 1944 into a Sicilian-American family, Farina&apos;s father Joseph, a physician, was an immigrant from Sicily. After a stint in the service, the Chicago native pinned on a badge and strapped on a gun for the Windy City&apos;s police department from 1967 to 1985. He mostly worked out of the burglary division, which brought him his chance. While he was still a cop in burglary, he was hired as a consultant by director &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv) for the movie _Thief (1981)_ (qv), in which &apos;James Caan (I)&apos; (qv) played a master burglar. Mann cast Farina in a bit part in the movie, which proved to be a small masterpiece. He worked many times with Mann in the future.  Bitten by the acting bug, Farina started acting in Chicago theater before Mann cast him in a lead role in his TV series _&quot;Crime Story&quot; (1986)_ (qv). Even though Farina was two years short of his pension, he quit the Chicago PD to take a chance on acting. He worked steadily in TV and movies ever since.  Farina proved adept at both drama and comedy, as his turn as gangster Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Barboni, &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s rival in _Get Shorty (1995)_ (qv) attested to. In addition to &quot;Crime Story&quot;, he also had a major role on _&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1990)_ (qv), essentially replacing &apos;Jerry Orbach&apos; (qv)&apos;s character. His last recurring role on TV was in the 2012 horse racing series _&quot;Luck&quot; (2011)_ (qv).  He was married for 10 years, from 1970 until his divorce in 1980. He and his wife Patricia had three sons; one of them, &apos;Joseph Farina (I)&apos; (qv), became an actor. Dennis Farina died in Scottsdale, Arizona on July 22, 2013 from a blood clot in his lung. He was 69 years old.</biography>

      <biography>Tatiana was born on the 13th of December 1956 in Taganrog, (The Azov Sea), Russia into a family of performers and the home town of Chekhov and F. Ranevskaya. At the age of 18 Tatiana left her homeland to pursue her career as an actress in the big city, MOSCOW. With nothing but Stanislavsky&apos;s words in her mind &apos;Have faith in ALL&apos;. Life had changed and was very far from easy but Tatiana managed to win her place at one of the most credited Moscow Theatrical Academy&apos;s of Performing Arts - RATI obtaining the Red Diploma in Professional Acting for Film, TV and Theatre. She then went on to work in the Moscow Film Industry as well as working in Georgia at the famous Russian-Georgian Culture Drama Theatre - Griboyedov.  Tatiana successfully established her name within the Russian Film Industry, from 1980-1992 completing 5 Feature Films, 10 TV Dramas, 12 Theatre productions (including classical, modern dramas, comedies and musicals), she then went onto write her first film movie script &apos;In The Shadow of Thy Wings Cover Me&apos;, a sensational story of love, loss and misfortune, that had one 1st prize at the international Aids Convention. Ironically came an unexpected betrayal and fall in Tatiana&apos;s career once the script came into production and dramatically changed her working position in Moscow.  This had discouraged Tatiana and had prompted the move London in 1992 to continue her acting career in the UK. More recently Tatiana had appeared in many cameo - character roles in various Film and TV productions in the UK and has worked with the likes of David Cronenberg, Mike Leigh and Otto Bathurst. In between Tatiana has travelled back to Russia to work on the new Alexander Brunkovski film &apos;Unseen Life&apos;, which proved to be a great success.  More recently Tatiana has been featured in Mark Foster&apos;s &apos;World War Z&apos;, playing the part of a Russian Lady alongside Brad Pitt in a very dramatically driven and emotionally evoking episode.</biography>

      <biography>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his &quot;10,000 Year Old Man&quot; album, based on his comedy routine with &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his &quot;angels&quot; by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn&apos;t appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _&quot;The Fashion Story&quot; (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _&quot;The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue&quot; (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. &apos;Max Liebman&apos; (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show&apos;s troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn&apos;t help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _&quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner&apos;s first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing &quot;The Professor&quot;, a character played by &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _&quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot; (1954)_ (qv). (&apos;Imogene Coca&apos; (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  &quot;Your Show or Shows&quot; had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young &apos;Bob Fosse&apos; (qv)) whereas &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot; was pure comedy. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, &apos;Howard Morris (I)&apos; (qv), and &apos;Nanette Fabray&apos; (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. In addition to &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv), the writing staff included &apos;Neil Simon (I)&apos; (qv), his brother &apos;Danny Simon (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Larry Gelbart&apos; (qv) and &apos;Mel Tolkin&apos; (qv). (There are rumors that the young &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv) served as the writing staff&apos;s typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, but he began writing formally for &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;, having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited &quot;writer without portfolio&quot;, he was able to leave writers&apos; meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, &quot;Man of the House&quot;, in which he would play a writer, &quot;Rob Petrie&quot;, who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv) (a &quot;benign despot&quot; who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. The network didn&apos;t pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner&apos;s part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv) on _&quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; (1956)_ (qv), and their routine &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot; was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down &quot;Man of the House&quot;, with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of &quot;Rob Petrie&quot; to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to &apos;Johnny Carson (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dick Van Dyke&apos; (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when &apos;Mary Tyler Moore&apos; (qv), &apos;Rose Marie (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Morey Amsterdam&apos; (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of &quot;Alan Brady&quot;, the abrasive &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series&apos; five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer &apos;Sheldon Leonard&apos; (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of &quot;Alan Brady&quot; on _&quot;Mad About You&quot; (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play &apos;Joseph Stein&apos; (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with &apos;Dick Van Dyke&apos; (qv), in creating a &apos;Stan Laurel&apos; (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where&apos;s Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with &apos;George Burns (I)&apos; (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with &apos;Steve Martin (I)&apos; (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner&apos;s career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the &apos;Mark Twain&apos; (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _&quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _&quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian &apos;Betty White (I)&apos; (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _&quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biography>

      <biography>Born in the northern Polish town of Bialystok, &apos;Izabella Scorupco&apos; (qv) moved to Sweden with her mother as a young child. She studied drama and music and, at 17, was discovered by a Swedish film director who cast her in the movie _Ingen kan älska som vi (1988)_ (qv), which made her a local teenage idol. She then became a successful model in Sweden and throughout Europe, where she made good use of her fluency in four languages.  In 1989, Scorupco displayed another facet of her talents, launching her career as a pop singer with her first single, Substitute. The single and subsequent album, IZA, both went gold, and she followed with another hit single, Shame, Shame, which she recorded in 1991. Returning to acting in 1994, she immediately won the lead role in the Swedish film _Petri tårar (1995)_ (qv). Scorupco stars as a woman who lives her life as a man in the medieval drama, which was released in August 1995.</biography>

      <gender>FEMALE</gender>
      <birthDateAsString>18 June 1960</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Broccoli, Barbara Dana</birthName>
      <biography>She is one of the entertainment industry&apos;s most successful female producers. Barbara Broccoli was born to legendary filmmaker &apos;Albert R. Broccoli&apos; (qv), affectionately known as Cubby, and &apos;Dana Broccoli&apos; (qv) on June 18, 1960. Not long after, Cubby Broccoli and his new partner, &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv), secured studio backing for an ambitious series of films inspired by the popular James Bond novels written by &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv).  Ms. Broccoli grew up in the behind-the-scenes world of James Bond, traveling with her family around the world to various exotic locations. As a child, she liked to play with the photocopy machines in the offices of Eon Productions, Ltd., her father&apos;s company responsible for the Bond films. During location shooting in Japan for _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), young Barbara caught a fever from the Japanese custom of sleeping on the floor. &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv), whose star status provided him with a comfortable bed, generously relinquished it so Barbara could properly fight her illness.  She graduated from Loyola University in Los Angeles, California with a degree in motion picture and television communications. Her first official credited job on the Bond films was for 1983&apos;s _Octopussy (1983)_ (qv) in which she served as an executive assistant. But, as with any family business, one helps out where one can. For instance, in her father&apos;s autobiography &quot;When The Snow Melts&quot;, she recalls a nightmarish situation involving _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv) star &apos;Grace Jones (I)&apos; (qv). Later, for the two &apos;Timothy Dalton&apos; (qv) Bond films, she was promoted to associate producer, a post she shared with veteran Bond associate producer &apos;Tom Pevsner&apos; (qv).  The August 8, 1990 issue of Variety (weekly) reported that aging Cubby Broccoli had turned control of Eon Productions Ltd. over to Barbara and her half-brother, &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) (Dana&apos;s son, who had been an invaluable help to Cubby and the Bond franchise in various capacities since the mid-1970s). Due to some unfortunate business dealings with then-MGM ownership (the studio that bankrolled Bond and held significant interest in the series), production of the Bond films was put on what would become a six year hiatus.  When the litigation was settled, &quot;Bond 17&quot; (eventually named _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) was on track and Barbara Broccoli, now a full producer alongside &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv), was faced with the challenge of bringing Bond back to the big screen. She has earned a reputation as being tough when she has to be and for volunteering for the toughest jobs, such as overseeing the Russian location unit. _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) was a world-wide smash, and each of the succeeding Bond films were also enormously popular. This is a testament to the talent of Cubby Broccoli, who passed his knowledge of high-stakes film production on to Michael and later Barbara. The benefit of Cubby&apos;s experience is obvious when viewing the newest Bond films starring &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv).  Her non-Bond producing credits include _Crime of the Century (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which deals with the murder trial from the famous Lindberg kidnapping, and the popular London Stage production of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, which was co-produced by her mother &apos;Dana Broccoli&apos; (qv) and half-brother &apos;Michael G. Wilson.&apos; Both productions carried a personal interest for Ms. Broccoli. Charles Lindberg was her father&apos;s favorite hero, and &quot;Chitty&quot; was adapted from the film produced by her father, which was based upon the children&apos;s novel by &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Kennedy, John Fitzgerald</birthName>
      <biography>John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, to Rose Fitzgerald (A.K.A. &apos;Rose Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Joseph P. Kennedy&apos; (qv). John was named after his maternal grandfather, John &quot;HoneyFitz&quot; Fitzgerald, the mayor of Boston. John was very ill as a child and was given the last rites five times, the first one being when he was a new-born. He was the second of four boys born to an Irish Catholic family with nine children: Joseph Jr., John, &apos;Robert F. Kennedy&apos; (qv) (called Bobby), and &apos;Ted Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv) (born Edward). Because Rose made Joe and Jack (the name his family called him) wear matching clothes, they fought a lot for attention. When John was young, the family moved from Boston to New York. John went to Choate, a private school. Most of the time, though, he was too sick to attend. In the late 1930s, father Joe became the ambassador to England. He took sons John and Robert with him, as well as his wife and daughters Kathleen and &apos;Rosemary Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv). John went to Princeton, then Harvard, and for his senior thesis, he wrote a piece about why England refused to get into the war until late. It was published in 1940 and called &quot;Why England Slept&quot;. His older brother Joe was a pilot during the war, and was killed when the bombs his plane was carrying exploded. Not long after that, John&apos;s sister Kathleen and her husband died in a plane crash. In the early 1950s, John ran for Congress in Massachusetts and won. He married &apos;Jacqueline Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv) (thirteen years his junior, born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier) on September 12, 1953. He became a father rather late in life. Their first child, &apos;Caroline Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv), was born on November 27, 1957 when J.F.K. was forty and their son, &apos;John Kennedy Jr.&apos; (qv), was born on November 25, 1960 when J.F.K. was forty-three. They had a son named Patrick Bouvier, but he died a few days after birth. In 1954, J.F.K. had to have back surgery and in the hospital wrote his second book, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. His father always said that his son Joe was going to be President of the U.S.; when he died in World War II, though, that task was passed on to John. He ran for president in 1960 against &apos;Richard Nixon&apos; (qv) and won. His administration had many conflicts, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis being key examples. In November 1963, he and Jackie (his wife&apos;s nickname) went on a trip to Texas. Everywhere they went there were signs saying &quot;Jack and Jackie.&quot; On November 22, 1963, John was to give a speech in Dallas, but on his way an assassin hidden on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository opened fire at Kennedy, who was riding in an open car. Hit twice and severely wounded, Kennedy died in a local hospital at 1:00 P.M. The alleged assassin, &apos;Lee Harvey Oswald&apos; (qv), was captured a short time later after shooting and killing a Dallas policeman, and was himself assassinated before he could be thoroughly interrogated, let alone tried. In just a little bit of irony, considering the death of &apos;Abraham Lincoln (I)&apos; (qv) a century earlier, Kennedy was shot in a Ford Lincoln (Lincoln was in Ford&apos;s Theater when he was shot). He was laid to rest on his son&apos;s third birthday.</biography>

      <biography>Tucker Francis Maloney was born to Vernon and Gladys Maloney in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Tucker to grow up as an only child.  Tucker&apos;s musical influences were the pop and country music of the day, the country gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he attended, as well as the black R&amp;B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954 he began his career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation.  Tucker starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record breaking, live concert performances. Globally, Tucker has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 130 different albums and singles.  His talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma and good humor endeared him to millions. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important cultural figures of twentieth century popular culture.</biography>

      <biography>Olga Kurylenko, a Ukrainian-born actress and model, went from sharing a cramped flat with her aunt, uncle, grandparents and cousin to starring as a Bond girl opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv).  She was born Olga Konstantinovna Kurylenko on November 14, 1979, in Berdyansk, Ukraine, Soviet Union. Her mother, Marina Alyabysheva, divorced her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, soon after her birth. After the divorce her mother struggled to survive as an art teacher. Young Olga was brought up by her mother and her grandmother, Raisa. During her youth Olga had the humbling experience of living in poverty; she had no choice but to wear rags and had to darn the holes on her sweater. During her years in Ukraine she studied art and languages and spent seven years studying piano at a local school of music in Berdyansk. She also went to a ballet studio until 13.  At age 13 Olga and her mother made a trip to Moscow. There she was spotted by an agent, who approached her at a subway station and offered her a job as a model. Initially Olga&apos;s mother was suspicious, but she checked the agent&apos;s credentials and eventually allowed Olga to accept training as a model in Moscow, which turned out to be a good career choice.  By age 16 she was ready for the next step. She moved to Paris, learned French in six months and was signed by the Madison agency. At age 18 she appeared on the cover of Glamour, and in short order graced the covers of Elle, Madame Figaro, Marie Claire, and Vogue. She also became the face of Lejaby lingerie, Bebe clothing, Clarins and Helena Rubinstein cosmetic companies.  In 1999 Olga married French photographer &apos;Cedric Van Mol&apos; (qv), but divorced him 3-1/2 years later. One day Olga presented herself to an acting agency. Eventually she swapped the catwalk for the movie screen, and her acting career took off. In 2005 she made her film debut as &quot;Iris&quot;, a sensual beauty, in _L&apos;annulaire (2005)_ (qv), by director &apos;Diane Bertrand&apos; (qv).  Olga&apos;s cinematic roles have been notably steamy, and her natural beauty and explicit nudity attracted the attention of the male audiences. She appeared opposite &apos;Elijah Wood&apos; (qv) in _Paris, je t&apos;aime (2006)_ (qv) and as &quot;Sofia&quot; in _Le serpent (2006)_ (qv), then co-starred as Russian beauty &quot;Nika Boronina&quot; opposite &apos;Timothy Olyphant (I)&apos; (qv) in _Hitman (2007/I)_ (qv). She also appeared as &quot;Mina Harud&quot; in the indie surveillance-thriller _&quot;Tyranny&quot; (2008)_ (qv). On Christmas Eve 2007, Olga was offered to play what will become her biggest hit: co-starring as &quot;Camille&quot;, the Bond girl, opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv) in _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv), a sequel to _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv).  With the international success as Bond Girl, Olga also made appearances on various TV productions in Russia and Ukraine. In 2012, Olga Kurylenko was cast as Julia, supporting role in the Sci-Fi adventure _Oblivion (2013/I)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Tom Cruse&apos; (qv) and &apos;Morgan Freeman (I)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Broccoli, Albert Romolo</birthName>
      <biography>Albert Romolo Broccoli was born in Astoria, Queens (New York City) on April 5th, 1909. His mother and father, Cristina and Giovanni Broccoli, raised young Albert in New York on the family farm. The family was in the vegetable business, and Albert claimed one of his uncles brought the first broccoli seeds into the United States in the 1870&apos;s. Albert&apos;s cousin &apos;Pat DiCicco&apos; (qv) gave him the nickname &quot;Cubby&quot; after a comic strip character named Kabibble. Cubby worked in a pharmacy and then as a coffin-maker, but a trip to see his cousin in Los Angeles gave him an ambition for film stardom. Pat was an actor&apos;s agent, and introduced Cubby to such stars as &apos;Randolph Scott (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Cary Grant (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Bob Hope (I)&apos; (qv).  In 1940, at the age of 31, Cubby married actress &apos;Gloria Blondell&apos; (qv). That same year the head of 20th Century-Fox offered him an assistant director position on _The Outlaw (1943)_ (qv), directed by &apos;Howard Hawks&apos; (qv) and produced by his good friend &apos;Howard Hughes (I)&apos; (qv). After this initial job opportunity Cubby became the top assistant director at Fox. He went on to serve as A.D. on such films as _The Song of Bernadette (1943)_ (qv) and _The Black Swan (1942)_ (qv). When World War II began, Cubby joined the U.S. Navy, where he met future film producer &apos;Ray Stark&apos; (qv), and together they become heads of entertainment for the troops. Cubby and Gloria decided to end their marriage in 1945, but remained good friends. After the war Cubby determined to get back into the movie business.  In 1946 his cousin Pat worked out the financing for a project called _Avalanche (1946)_ (qv), on which Cubby served as production manager. The film spawned a partnership between Cubby and director &apos;Irving Allen&apos; (qv). Broccoli and Allen later formed Warwick Productions, which eventually became a very successful independent production company based in London, England. After the poor response to &quot;Avalanche&quot;, however, Broccoli worked various odd jobs, including selling Christmas trees in California, and eventually took a job as a talent agent, where he represented, among others, &apos;Robert Wagner (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Lana Turner&apos; (qv).  In 1951 Cubby married Nedra Clark. That same year he left the talent agency and, together with his partner Allen, reformed Warwick to make _The Red Beret (1953)_ (qv). The film, released in the US as &quot;Paratrooper&quot;, was very profitable. Broccoli and Allen become the most successful independent producers in England, turning out such hits as _Safari (1956)_ (qv), _Zarak (1956)_ (qv) and _The Bandit of Zhobe (1959)_ (qv). Cubby and Nedra wanted to start a family but, according to the doctor, Nedra was unable to become pregnant. They instead adopted a young baby boy named Tony. Shortly afterwards Nedra became pregnant after all, and gave birth to a girl, whom they named Tina. Unfortunately, Nedra died in New York shortly afterwards. Cubby was now a widower with two children to raise. He spent months trying to get new film projects off the ground and support his family.  Cubby met &apos;Dana Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) at a New Year&apos;s Eve party and there was an instant attraction. The two fell in love and, after five weeks, Cubby proposed marriage. Dana flew to London and started a new life with Cubby. However, things were about to turn sour for him. After making _The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960)_ (qv), which was financed out of his and Allen&apos;s own pockets, the two went bankrupt due to the poor box-office returns because of adverse reaction to the subject matter--&apos;Oscar Wilde&apos; (qv)&apos;s homosexuality. The film wasn&apos;t allowed to be advertised in the US and never made back its production costs during initial release. Cubby and Allen ended their partnership after the failure of the film. On June 18, 1960, Dana gave birth to a baby girl, &apos;Barbara Broccoli&apos; (qv). One night Dana asked Cubby if there was something he really wanted to do. Cubby replied. &quot;I always wanted to film the &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) James Bond books.&quot;  Cubby then managed to meet with &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv), the man who held the option to the books. Together they formed Eon Productions Ltd. and Danjaq S.A. to make the first James Bond film, _Dr. No (1962)_ (qv). However, they needed financing. The two men flew to New York and met with &apos;Arthur Krim&apos; (qv), the head of United Artists. Within the hour Broccoli and Saltzman had a deal to make the first 007 film adventure. Despite the small budget of $1 million, the producers insisted on filming on location in Jamaica and using the then virtually unknown &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv) in the title role. Bond became the most successful film series in history and made Cubby Broccoli a household name.  Together with Saltzman, Broccoli produced _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv), _Goldfinger (1964)_ (qv), _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), _On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service (1969)_ (qv), _Diamonds Are Forever (1971)_ (qv), _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) and _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). After nine years as partners, Saltzman sold his share of Eon/Danjaq to United Artists and Cubby became the sole producer of the James Bond films. He later brought in his stepson, &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv), and his daughter Barbara, making it a true family affair. Broccoli&apos;s last non-Bond film was _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)_ (qv). He had purchased the rights to this &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) story when he got the 007 book option. They brought in songwriters &apos;Richard M. Sherman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Robert B. Sherman&apos; (qv), who were under contract to Disney, to write the music for this musical.  In 1982 Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Award for his long and successful producing career. The award was presented by &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv) at the Academy Awards ceremony. Broccoli stated that it was one of the happiest days of his life and was very pleased to have received such a great honor. He stopped during his speech to thank all of the hundreds of crew technicians and actors who have helped make his films possible. In 1990 he was honored by having his star placed on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and was even honored by the Queen of England for his contribution to cinema and the British community. Broccoli&apos;s last film was _Licence to Kill (1989)_ (qv). He had heart problems throughout the early 1990s and was unable to go to the set of _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).  Cubby&apos;s last years were spent at his home in Beverly Hills, surrounded by his children and grandchildren. Despite awards, honors and an amazing film career, the most important thing in his life was his family. After undergoing a triple-bypass in 1995, Cubby Broccoli passed away on Thursday, June 27, 1996, surrounded by loved ones. He was 87 and was one of the best-loved and most respected producers in Hollywood. No one ever had anything bad to say about Cubby and, according to many, he was a gentleman who cared about every one of his cast and crew and was the last true film producer. Albert R. &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli&apos;s legacy lives on thanks to his family, which carries on the tradition of making the James Bond films.</biography>

      <birthName>Zahn, James Charles</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Chicago Heights, Illinois in the late 1970s, James spent much of his youth growing up in the South Suburbs of Chicago. Obsessed with pop-culture in its many forms, he spent much of his time drawing, writing, and focusing on becoming a performer of some sort.  In 1987 his original short story &quot;The Little Champ&quot; became an Illinois Young Author Award winner, and the seeds for a career as a writer were planted. Less than two years later, the budding filmmaker would also emerge.  Having grown up in front of a camera, with his childhood exploits captured by his parents on Super 8mm home movies, James shot his first short film &quot;Art Attack&quot; using the very same camera in early 1989. The film made its debut for classmates at his school.  By the time high school rolled around, all of James&apos; interests were actively being pursued. After moving to Davenport, Iowa in the spring of 1992, he began work on a cable-access program that was quite ambitious for a 15-year old. &quot;ZTV&quot; made its debut in the summer of 1992 and became a cult hit in Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois. Practically overnight, the show was featured in the local news-media, and attracted musical guests such as Faith No More, Megadeth, Stone Temple Pilots, and more. In the spring of 1994, after 40 Episodes, &quot;ZTV&quot; came to an end with a 30 minute special featuring the band &quot;White Zombie&quot;.  At the same time &quot;ZTV&quot; was on the air, James was also actively writing and taking photographs for three regional arts magazines. His published work would include interviews with artists such as Pantera, Dr. John, and Genitorturers, and led him to be a photographer at Lollapalooza &apos;93.  The mid 90s was a time of experimentation on the musical front. Zahn was soon fronting the rock band &quot;Odlid!&quot;, performing guitar and vocals. The band appeared on numerous compilation CDs, and recorded one-full length album, before breaking-up in early 1998. In addition, they performed at famed venues such as Gabe&apos;s Oasis (Iowa City), RIBCO (Rock Island, IL), and Chicago&apos;s historic Riviera Theatre, sharing the stage with acts such as Demolition Dollrods, Johnny Socko, and more.  In 2000, James returned to music with a series of unreleased demos, followed by one Internet cult favorite (Darth Vader is A Real Cool Guy), and a track for Artisan Entertainment&apos;s &quot;Blair Witchmix&quot;, an on-line soundtrack to promote the ill-fated &quot;Blair Witch 2&quot;. His track, &quot;Burkittsville&quot; was featured along 12 other tracks, by artists such as Jane&apos;s Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins, and Marilyn Manson, being performed as a part of the _Blair Witch WebFest (2000)_ (qv) .  In 2001, James returned to film, where he has been ever since, and intends to stay. He and his wife soon founded FMFE as an outlet for his creative endeavors. Since that time, James has directed numerous short films, music videos,industrials, and much more. In addition, acting had become a main passion.  Keeping the music going as well, James entered Kenosha, Wisconsin&apos;s Renwood Messenger Studios in February of 2004 to begin work on a concept project called &quot;Saturday Action Theatre&quot;, producing four acoustic tracks from those sessions. In July, he entered Bombshelter Studios in Chicago, with Producer Dan Precision (Break The Silence, Rise Against) and cut 3 electric tracks, completing what would become the &quot;Remakes and Sequels EP&quot;. The disc hit stores on August 17, 2004.  Forging ahead into a bigger filmic realm, James began work on the screenplay for &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; in late 2004. Completed in February 2005, the multi-genre epic spent several years in &quot;development hell&quot;, all while gaining a global fanbase. Nominated for a SpikeTV &quot;Scream Award&quot; for &quot;Most Anticipated Film&quot; in 2007 (while still in-development), the project would find new life in January 2008.  After moving forward under the control of Zahn and his writing partner &apos;Ben Brezinski&apos; (qv), &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; was back in-development as an independent film along with it&apos;s already-written sequel &quot;The Long December.&quot; On June 26th, 2008 Issue #0 of the comic book prequel series also called &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; made it&apos;s public debut at Wizard World Chicago, largely regarded as the 2nd Largest Pop-Culture Event in North America. The book quickly gained acceptance by readers and critics alike as positive reviews began appearing online. Issue #0 was published by The Scream Factory, and was called a &quot;must-have&quot; by Comics Buyer&apos;s Guide. In October 2008 it was announced that the &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; comic books would being published by Fangoria Graphix, the relaunched comic arm of Fangoria Magazine. After publishing only one new issue of the series and a reissue of #0, Fangoria Graphix went out of business due to continued restructuring of the parent company. The books then returned to The Scream Factory for future publication.  In addition, James continued working steadily as an actor, appearing in projects for Warner Bros., Twentieth Century Fox, and Sony Pictures. He recently appeared in the feature film _Lonely Joe (2009)_ (qv) in a supporting role alongside &apos;Erica Leerhsen&apos; (qv) of _Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007) (V)_ (qv) fame, and voiced several famous &quot;Transformers&quot; characters for a sketch on G4TV&apos;s &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;. In November of 2008, Zahn began appearing in television commercials for Wendy&apos;s, an American chain of fast-food restaurants. Around the same time, he appeared in an &quot;Alcohol Sales Training&quot; video for Walgreens stores.  In August of 2010, Zahn announced via Twitter that he would be taking a break from acting to focus on personal projects, including his work with Kik Axe Music. A November article with Reel Chicago revealed that not only would The Scream Factory be publishing more &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; books, but that a film set in the DWTS world would be in development once more at some point in the near future.  2011 saw a return to filmmaking via music videos and short films. A concept short film was created for the band Product of Hate and their song entitled &quot;Unholy Manipulator.&quot; Filmed over three days in and around Crestline, Ohio, _Hellraiser (1987)_ (qv) actress &apos;Ashley Laurence&apos; (qv) stars as the title character. With production and special FX provided by &apos;Robert Kurtzman&apos; (qv) , a mid-2012 release date is expected.  In 2012, Zahn revealed that he would be leaving his writing and editing duties at Kik Axe Music behind in order to focus on his personal site, The Rock Father. A family-friendly destination geared toward &quot;music-loving caregivers and kids,&quot; the site was expanded from a hosted blog to a standalone full-service site on February 1, 2012.  Additionally, music-centric filmmaking has continued, as Zahn directed and edited the Product of Hate music video &quot;Blood Coated Concrete&quot; (released Feb 7, 2012), the Dirge Within lyric video &quot;For My Enemies&quot; (released March 7, 2012), and the album trailer for &quot;The Industrialist,&quot; the eighth studio album from the band &apos;Fear Factory&apos; (qv) .</biography>

      <biography>By age 22, Nathan Roberson had already acquired a resume that most people only dream about. As a child , Nathan practically grew up on the soundstages of Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida. His handsome profile and natural &quot;boyish&quot; charms made him a commodity for the production team at Nickelodeon. However, his parents made sure his schooling always came first. After college, Nathan made the beautiful Los Angeles suburb of Toluca Lake, California his primary home, but still makes frequent trips back and forth to Orlando. In early 2000, Nathan was cast in a teen talk show consisting of five principle hosts. He was shocked to learn soon after, that the pilot and potential series would be shot and produced in his hometown of Orlando! Unfortunately, the show wasn&apos;t picked up that season, but one of the show&apos;s producers approached Nathan the last day of shooting and expressed an interest in using him for several other projects in the near future. From that day on, Nathan has remained very busy with a lot of television commercials and music videos. In the rare event of any spare time, Nathan enjoys an active social life in both Los Angeles and Orlando and is very grateful for all the support he receives from his family and his fans.</biography>

      <biography>Nicholas - or Nick - Woodeson, born in 1949 in England to British parents - spent his early childhood in Haifa in Israel in line with his parents&apos; diplomatic postings and recalls that his first taste of thespian glory was reciting A. A. Milne poems to family friends at the age of six. Nick&apos;s strong affinity and regard for the Middle East has meant that, in the 2000s, he has written several heart-felt letters to English broadsheet newspapers expressing his views on the Middle East crisis and American involvement therein. Sent back to England to complete a boarding school education, he went on to Sussex University where his interest in drama re-surfaced and he engaged in competitive productions for the British National Student Drama Festival. As a consequence he was noticed by , and obtained his first acting job for, the theatrical repertory company at Crewe in Cheshire, England, ruefully noting in hindsight that he was usually a prompter or assistant stage manager, rather than a player. However, he soon obtained a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, and later joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, in 1981, remaining with them intermittently until 1990. He has consequently appeared in other media including films like &apos;Topsy-Turvy&apos; and television dramas like &apos;Midsomer Murders&apos; in 1998, where he played one of several murder suspects, along with actress Angela Pleasence. A year later, Angela and Nick played a mother and son in the stage play &apos;The Late Middle Classes&apos;,notwithstanding the fact that, with no more than a decade&apos;s age gap between them. From 2007, he reached a global audience as Julius Caesar&apos;s clever and loyal &quot;body slave&quot; Posca, in the BBC/HBO TV blockbuster, &apos;Rome&apos;.</biography>

      <birthName>Damon, Matthew Paige</birthName>
      <biography>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to &apos;Kent Damon&apos; (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and &apos;Nancy Carlsson-Paige&apos; (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5&apos;10&quot; star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) and &apos;Vin Diesel&apos; (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite &apos;Edward Norton (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;John Malkovich&apos; (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv) and fellow comedian, &apos;Chris Rock (I)&apos; (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played &quot;Tom Ripley&quot;, a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both &apos;Jude Law&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gwyneth Paltrow&apos; (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside &apos;Will Smith (I)&apos; (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by &apos;Steven Soderbergh&apos; (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers&apos; _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv).

      <birthName>Lewis, Lennox Claudius</birthName>
      <biography>After a long amateur career that included a gold medal winning performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics that came in the form of a KO of &apos;Riddick Bowe&apos; (who also went on to win the world heavyweight crown), former undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis turned professional in 1989. His 2 round win over Canadian boxer Donnovan Ruddock in Oct of 1992 gained him recognition as a threat among the tough heavyweight ranks. Lewis, a citizen of England and Canada, was slated for a shot at the winner of &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) vs Riddick Bowe. Bowe, a victim of a brutal knockout suffered at the hands of Lewis in the amateur ranks, refused to live up to his end of the bargain by not giving Lewis a well-deserved title shot and infamously tossed the WBC title in a garbage bin. This act prompted the WBC commission to strip Bowe and crown Lewis as the new WBC champion. Lennox Lewis went on to defend the crown for several fights until he was defeated by Oliver McCall in 2 rounds in Sept of 1994. Lewis, with the help of new trainer &apos;Emanuel Steward&apos; (qv), came back and began tearing his way through the ranks of the heavyweight division. Lewis was again denied a title shot when champion &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv) relinquished his WBC title to fight &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) rather than risk his titles against Lewis. Lewis recaptured the vacant WBC title by beating his conquerer Oliver McCall in a rematch. Lewis, after defeating every top contender thrown his way, was given his shot at &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) in a championship unification fight on March 13, 1999. Lewis dominated the fight but due to controversial judging, the bout was declared a draw. Lewis defeated &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) in a rematch on Nov 13, 1999 to become undisputed world champion. Due to promoter &apos;Don King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s underhanded tactics, the WBA belt was stripped from Lewis in court. Lewis went on to beat every mandatory challenger while keeping his crown. While avidly issuing challenges to reluctant contender &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv), Lewis went to Johannesburg in South Africa at the invitation of &apos;Nelson Mandela&apos; (qv). Lewis would defend his titles against supposed low-risk opponent Hasim Rahman. Due to Lewis&apos; failure to prepare for the fight by dropping excessive weight rapidly, arriving in Johannesburg 2 weeks before the fight which, according to expert opinion, was too late to acclimatize to the thin air since Johannesburg was 5,000 feet above sea level, Lewis suffered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, Lewis has had his rematch with Hashim Rahman and won the title back, and he also fought &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv) and beaten him &apos;easily&apos; in 8 rounds.</biography>

      <birthName>McGinley, John Christopher</birthName>
      <biography>John C. McGinley&apos;s path to stardom is a story that reads like a classic Hollywood script. While an understudy in New York in the Circle-In-The-Square production of John Patrick Shanley&apos;s &quot;Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,&quot; he was spotted by director Oliver Stone and soon after was cast in &quot;Platoon,&quot; the first of a long list of collaborations between Stone and McGinley which includes &quot;Wall Street,&quot; &quot;Talk Radio,&quot; &quot;Born on the Fourth of July,&quot; &quot;Nixon&quot; and &quot;Any Given Sunday.&quot;  He has received rave reviews for his work in NBC&apos;s Emmy-nominated medical comedy series, &quot;Scrubs&quot; - now in production on its seventh and final season. TV Guide proclaimed, &quot;The young cast is appealing, but McGinley steals the show as the mercurial doctor who deep down actually gives a damn. So will you.&quot; And the San Francisco Chronicle glowed, &quot;If [McGinley] doesn&apos;t win the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy, I&apos;m going to bring the smack-down to the Emmy voters.&quot;  John C. relishes the chance to portray the gruff, worldly &apos;Dr. Perry Cox&apos; on &quot;Scrubs.&quot; &quot;As an actor, it&apos;s great to play a strong leader with a heart of gold,&quot; he offers. &quot;Dr. Cox mentors the rookie doctors with a spoonful of dirt and then a cup of sugar. I see him as an archetypal descendant of two of my favorite curmudgeonly characters: Lou Grant and Louie De Palma.&quot;  Most recently, John C. starred opposite Ice Cube in Sony/Revolution Studios&apos; feature, &quot;Are We Done Yet?,&quot; the sequel to the hit comedy &quot;Are We There Yet?.&quot; &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot; picks up as the family moves from the big city to the suburbs for an idyllic life. A house renovation leads to chaos, particularly when the enthusiastic and larger-than-life real estate agent/neighbor/contractor &apos;Chuck Mitchell, Jr.&apos; (John C. McGinley) who is hired to work on the home, clashes with Ice Cube&apos;s character but bonds with his wife and kids. Of John C.&apos;s performance, The New York Times proclaimed, &quot;....a marvelous John C. McGinley, playing a dodgy jack-of-all-trades with the kind of energy that forces other actors to step up their game. He is so good. He redeems his character through acting skill alone.&quot;  John C. voiced the main character in &quot;Dead Head Fred,&quot; an original PSP (PlayStation) game featuring dark humor and a violent portrayal of revenge and redemption. John C. will bring to life &apos;Fred Neuman,&apos; a private detective savagely murdered and then resurrected in a bizarre scientific experiment without his memory or his head.  John C.&apos;s impressive career in film spans a diverse range of characters in over sixty features to date. He has also appeared in such features as &quot;Wild Hogs,&quot; &quot;Identity,&quot; &quot;The Animal,&quot; &quot;The Rock,&quot; &quot;Nothing to Lose,&quot; &quot;Set It Off,&quot; &quot;Seven,&quot; &quot;Office Space,&quot; &quot;Mother,&quot; &quot;Wagons East,&quot; &quot;Surviving the Game,&quot; &quot;On Deadly Ground,&quot; &quot;Point Break,&quot; &quot;Highlander II,&quot; &quot;A Midnight Clear&quot; and &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy.&quot;  John C. has a solid commitment to the independent film community as well as the studio system. He appeared in director Eriq La Salle&apos;s &quot;Crazy As Hell&quot; and director Scott Silver&apos;s &quot;Johns.&quot; He also worked on &quot;Truth or Consequences, N.M.,&quot; Kiefer Sutherland&apos;s feature directorial debut; and on &quot;Colin Fitz,&quot; a film John C. co-produced which premiered in competition at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. He recently starred in director D.B. Sweeney&apos;s independent feature, &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise,&quot; which is currently receiving raves on the festival circuit. For his performance in the later film, John C. was awarded Method Fest&apos;s Festival Director&apos;s Award, which is awarded for special recognition/excellence in film.  He is a partner at McGinley Entertainment Inc., an independent film production company with several projects currently in development. John C. first worked both sides of the camera, serving double duty as actor and producer for the romantic comedy &quot;Watch It!&quot; (with Peter Gallagher and Lili Taylor).  For television, he received stunning reviews for his starring role in Dean Koontz&apos;s gripping and highly rated 1997 suspense drama, &quot;Intensity,&quot; a four-hour original film for FOX-TV. Of his performance, the New York Times stated, &quot;John C. McGinley plays &apos;Vess&apos; with effective cold-blooded menace. It is McGinley, in a strong, low-key performance, who emerges as the film&apos;s secret weapon. His face is familiar from many movie roles where his guy-next-door looks have made him a natural sidekick. As the murderer with the unlikely name &apos;Edgler Vess,&apos; he uses that regular-guy demeanor to make the character especially chilling.&quot;</biography>

      <biography>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) and &apos;Robert Rodriguez (I)&apos; (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk them.  Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for Uma Thurman&apos;s role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol. 1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle Barry&apos;s _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv).  Bell&apos;s talent can not only be seen on the big screen but also in the cult television series _&quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; (1995)_ (qv) where she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC thriller _&quot;Alias&quot; (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double for Vicki Pratti.  In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell along with legendary stunt-woman &apos;Jeannie Epper&apos; (qv) give an insight into the career of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated career.  Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes to someday own a home in New Zealand.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>3 October 1964</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Recently breaking into the top ranks of British superstars who are making it huge in Hollywood, the smoothly virile actor Clive Owen was born on October 3, 1964, in Coventry. His father was a country/western singer who deserted his family when Clive was only 3. He attended Binley Park Comprehensive School and joined the youth theater at 13 after playing the scene-stealing role of the Artful Dodger in a production of &quot;Oliver!&quot; In 1984, following graduation, Clive applied and was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for three years. While there, he built up a classical resume including roles in &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and &quot;The Lady from the Sea.&quot; He subsequently joined the Young Vic Theatre Company and in 1988, the handsome actor, while playing Romeo, fell in love with his Juliet, &apos;Sarah-Jane Fenton&apos; (qv). The couple eventually married in 1995 and have two daughters.  1988 was a good year for another reason. Clive made his film debut in the British-made _Vroom (1988)_ (qv) co-starring with &apos;David Thewlis&apos; (qv) as two fellows who restore a classic American car and take off on the road. Within two years, Clive became a full-fledged TV star playing devilish rogue Stephen Crane in _&quot;Chancer&quot; (1990)_ (qv). However, the now-sought-after Clive abandoned the star-making part at the height of the show&apos;s popularity because of unwanted invasion of privacy and his fear of typecasting. His next project raised more than a few eyebrows when he filmed _Close My Eyes (1991)_ (qv) in which he played a brother who acts on his incestuous desires for his older sister. Clive&apos;s reputation as a lovable shyster was completely shattered and he lost profitable commercial endorsements following the film&apos;s release. Offers fell off for the next two years as a result. But the persistent Clive carried on with stage work, including the role of a bisexual in a production of &apos;Noel Coward&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Design For Living.&quot; He returned to TV at that time as well and played a number of roles in both mini-movies and series.  In 1997, Clive had a huge hit on the London stage with &quot;Closer,&quot; a cynical, contemporary ensemble piece about relationships. Controversy surrounded him again in the film role of Max in _Bent (1997)_ (qv) playing a brash, reckless homosexual lothario in decadent pre-war Germany who finds unconditional love while interned in a Nazi war camp. His biggest film break, however, was in &apos;Mike Hodges (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; _Croupier (1998)_ (qv), as a struggling writer-turned-casino employee who gets in over his head with a femme fatale scam artist. English audiences stayed away in droves but the U.S. embraced the film and Hollywood took notice of Clive, who was virtually unknown outside of England. Despite playing detective Ross Tanner in a series of successful &quot;Second Sight&quot; mini-movies and finding critical acclaim on stage with &quot;The Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; in 2001, Clive has focused primarily on film, including the offbeat Brit romantic comedy _Greenfingers (2000)_ (qv), the classy and popular &apos;Robert Altman (I)&apos; (qv) film _Gosford Park (2001)_ (qv), the &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv) star-vehicle _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), and the title role in _King Arthur (2004)_ (qv). He has since reached the top rungs of the Hollywood ladder with the film version of his stage smash _Closer (2004/I)_ (qv), in which he received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA award for &quot;Supporting Actor&quot;; opposite &apos;Denzel Washington&apos; (qv) in _Inside Man (2006)_ (qv); and alongside &apos;Julianne Moore&apos; (qv) and &apos;Michael Caine (I)&apos; (qv) in _Children of Men (2006)_ (qv). Upcoming is his portrayal of Sir Walter Raleigh opposite &apos;Cate Blanchett&apos; (qv)&apos;s Elizabeth I in the film _Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007)_ (qv). There seems to be only bigger and better things awaiting this versatile talent. Ever since playing the ultra-cool driver in BMW&apos;s &quot;The Hire&quot; series, there has been constant pressure for Clive to don a tux and become filmdom&apos;s next &quot;James Bond&quot;. It has yet to happen, but it seems like it would be a perfect fit.</biography>

      <biography>Mike Dopud is a man with presence. As an actor, his screen presence has a far different kind of impact than the kind he used to deliver as a professional athlete -- Both are hard-hitting and memorable.  Dopud was born in Montreal, Canada, the second son of a Yugoslavian family. Mike speaks three languages fluently (English, French, and Serbian). Graduating with a degree in Physiology and International Business Administration from Southern Illinois University where he was a four-year letterman, Dopud went on to a pro-football career in the Canadian Football League that was cut short by a knee injury. After rehabilitating his knee, he found himself back on skates playing pro hockey for the in the Minor Leagues. Plagued by injury, his sports career ended abruptly.  It wasn&apos;t long after Dopud had his first taste of the film industry on the hit television series _&quot;The X Files&quot; (1993)_ (qv). &quot;I was hooked.&quot; Dopud&apos;s talent, rugged good looks, and screen presence has also caught the attention of casting directors. His forty acting credits over the last few years has made this working actor someone to watch for and someone who is hard to miss. In the soon-to-be released _In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007)_ (qv), Dopud plays General Backler. Some of Dopud&apos;s other recent film credits include _300 (2006)_ (qv), _White Noise (2005)_ (qv), _BloodRayne (2005)_ (qv), _Rollerball (2002)_ (qv), _I Spy (2002)_ (qv), _X2 (2003)_ (qv), _I, Robot (2004)_ (qv), and _Canada Russia &apos;72 (2006) (TV)_ (qv). Dopud has had recurring roles on such shows as _&quot;Smallville&quot; (2001)_ (qv), _&quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2004)_ (qv), _&quot;Jeff Ltd.&quot; (2005)_ (qv), _&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (1997)_ (qv), and _&quot;Millennium&quot; (1996/I)_ (qv). This fall, Mike can be seen on MTV playing the role of Don Harris on the new series _&quot;Kaya&quot; (2007)_ (qv).  His size and professional sports background landed Dopud regular stunt work while he steadily began building his acting resume. His &quot;day at the office&quot; in stunt work has included being set on fire, hit by a car, falling off buildings thrown through windows and down stairs, flying through walls, and more fight scenes than &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv) has fought professional bouts. He&apos;s duked it out with &apos;Dwayne Johnson (I)&apos; (qv) (_Walking Tall (2004)_ (qv)), &apos;Jason Statham&apos; (qv) (_Chaos (2005/II)_ (qv)), &apos;Vin Diesel&apos; (qv) (_The Chronicles of Riddick (2004)_ (qv)), &apos;Jessica Alba&apos; (qv) (Dark Angel), &apos;Lucy Liu (I)&apos; (qv) (_Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (2002)_ (qv)), &apos;Jean-Claude Van Damme&apos; (qv) (_Replicant (2001)_ (qv)), and the Charlestown Chiefs in the sequel to the cult classic _Snapshot (1979)_ (qv): _Slap Shot 2: Breaking the Ice (2002) (V)_ (qv). Most recently Dopud has been nominated for a 2005 Taurus World Stunt Awards for Best High Work in the movie _Walking Tall (2004)_ (qv).  Dopud is also excited that he has returned to the stage most recently in the original plays: Rockets Red Glare and Of Diners and Buses. And Two Small Bodies. Gingham Dog.</biography>

      <biography>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that&apos;s what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.  After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother&apos;s collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play &quot;Dylan&apos;s Ghost&quot; at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.  Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he&apos;s almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he&apos;s come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director&apos;s second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way&apos;s New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist&apos;s print worth $80.</biography>

      <birthName>Howard, Ronald William</birthName>
      <biography>Ron was born in Oklahoma, into an acting family - his father had realized a boyhood dream of acting by attending the University of Oklahoma and majoring in drama, and his mother went through acting school in New York. He was in his first movie at 18 months, _Frontier Woman (1956)_ (qv), although his first real part was at the age of 4. Soon a regular on _&quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1956)_ (qv), he was cast as Opie on _&quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1960)_ (qv), and later moved from a child in Mayberry to America&apos;s teenager as Richie Cunningham in _&quot;Happy Days&quot; (1974)_ (qv). The life of a child star is certainly not routine, but Ron&apos;s parents wanted his life to be as normal as possible - he attended public schools and at age 15 even took nine months off to play a basketball season. The transition from child actor to adult actor is always difficult, but for Ron the real transition was from child actor to adult director. There were some film roles, such as _The Shootist (1976)_ (qv) for which he received a Golden Globe nomination, but his dream and now his focus was directing. He had begun shooting films at age 15 with a Super-8 camera, and after high school spent two years in a film program at the University of Southern California, but then left, feeling he could learn more from actual experience. That first film was the hardest to finance, but he struck a deal with &apos;Roger Corman&apos; (qv) - he would star in _Eat My Dust (1976)_ (qv) and Corman would produce _Grand Theft Auto (1977)_ (qv) which Howard would direct (he also wrote the script and starred). It was a success, and his directorial career was jump-started. Married since 1975 to his high school sweetheart, he, in 1997, is enjoying a life of telling stories as one of Hollywood&apos;s top directors.</biography>

      <birthName>Soderbergh, Steven A.</birthName>
      <biography>Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, &apos;Peter Soderbergh&apos; (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university&apos;s film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film &quot;Janitor&quot;. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group &apos;Yes&apos; (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival&apos;s Palme d&apos;Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress &apos;Betsy Brantley&apos; (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray&apos;s Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars.</biography>

      <biography>When you grow up in America&apos;s most dangerous city, Flint, MI, a dream like this seems completely unobtainable and vaguely ludicrous. The external forces of drugs, violence, and poverty exude the power of influence, yet Kay&apos;s internal quest for absolute freedom through acting could not be ignored.  Kay was accepted into Harvard University&apos;s American Repertory Theater/Moscow Art Theatre School Institute in 2013. Her intense desire to achieve greatness and personal freedom pointed Kay to the theater. She has been given the opportunity to channel her once private emotions and experiences in a positive manner. Suddenly, the abandonment caused by her parents&apos; drug and alcohol addictions, the pain caused by premature sensual attention, and her unprecedented level of focus caused by bullies became worth sharing.  In 2004, Kay obtained a B.A. in Communications and a M.A. in Public Relations from Michigan State University, however it led Kay to sitting behind desks, observing human behavior versus standing on stages illuminating human behavior. It was not until she moved to New Orleans in 2010 that she discovered true happiness and the buried talent that was screaming for attention. The film industry started taking the city by storm after Hurricane Katrina, and Kay subconsciously wanted to know more about it.  Kay started as a featured background artist, yet she was handpicked by four Academy Award winners and nominees. Michael Jackson once said, &quot;Study the great and become greater.&quot; Observing and learning from Quentin Tarantino, Gavin Hood, Richard LaGravenese and Lee Daniels caused Kay to take a much-needed inward look. Within one year, she arose from the background and became a principle player.</biography>

      <biography>Gregor Collins is an actor, author, screenwriter and producer best known for his starring roles in the indie films _Night Before the Wedding (2009)_ (qv) and _Goodbye Promise (2012)_ (qv), and for his bestselling memoir &quot;The Accidental Caregiver.&quot;  Gregor&apos;s first job in entertainment was in 1996 in Miami, Florida working as a PA for Caspar Weinberger&apos;s _&quot;World Business Review&quot; (1996)_ (qv). After graduating from Florida State with a BA in Media Production, he moved to Los Angeles and produced reality television shows such as _&quot;Ripley&apos;s Believe It or Not!&quot; (1999)_ (qv) and _E!&apos;s Live Countdown to the 2003 Primetime Emmy Awards (2003) (TV)_ (qv).  After four years in reality he decided to pursue a career in acting and writing.  Since the shift he&apos;s written, acted in and/or produced various independent features, including 2012&apos;s critically acclaimed improvised film _Goodbye Promise (2012)_ (qv), which the LA Times called &quot;a visually alert, enormously well-observed film that deftly captures Hollywood heartbreak,&quot; giving credit to Collins&apos; &quot;appealing and affecting&quot; performance.  Legendary Producer &apos;Fred Roos&apos; (qv) said this about _Goodbye Promise (2012)_ (qv): &quot;On a micro budget, Filmmaker &apos;David Branin&apos; (qv) and Actor &apos;Gregor Collins&apos; (qv) have created a perceptive and touching portrait of the lives of struggling actors working on the fringes of Hollywood.&quot;  In 2008, after a chance meeting with a renowned Holocaust refugee named &apos;Maria Altmann&apos; (qv), Collins became her caregiver for the last three years of her life. In 2012 he published a book about his unique experience called &quot;The Accidental Caregiver,&quot; which subsequently became a bestseller on Amazon.</biography>

      <biography>Ronald Reagan was a successful Hollywood actor who was president of the Screen Actors Guild, then turned politician and served two terms as Governor for California, then two terms as President of the United States of America.  He owned a 688 acre ranch in the Santa Ynes valley, north of Santa Barbara that had been used for location shooting Hollywood movies. The Reagans sold most of the ranch, then converted the rest of it, about 200 acres, into a magnificent estate overlooking the valley and the Pacific Ocean. The Rancho del Cielo became President Reagan&apos;s much needed counterpoint to the buzz of Washington, D.C. There, in a setting both rugged and serene, the Reagans could spend time alone or receive political leaders such as the Soviet President &apos;Mikhail Gorbachev&apos; (qv), Margaret Thatcher, and others.  Reagan is best known to the world for his one-liners, the most famous of them was addressed to &apos;Mikhail Gorbachev&apos; (qv) in 1987. &quot;Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall&quot; said Reagan standing in front of the Berlin Wall. That call made an impact on the course of human history.</biography>

      <birthName>Burns, Edward Fitzgerald</birthName>
      <biography>Edward Burns was born on January 28th 1968 in Woodside, Queens New York. The second of three children of Irish-Catholic immigrants. His father Edward J. Burns was a police sergeant and active spokesperson for the New York Police Dept. His mother, Molly, worked for the Federal Aviation Administration at Kennedy Airport. Edward, along with his older sister Mary and brother Brian were raised in Long Island. He attended Catholic Chaminade High School before transferring to a public high school. He went on to attend The State University of New York at Albany and Oneonta College in New York to major in English literature. During his junior year he transferred to Hunter College in Manhattan, studied filmmaking and began writing the first of many short films.  Upon graduating, and through his father&apos;s connections, he secured a job at Entertainment Tonight (1981) (TV) in 1993 working at as a &quot;go-fer&quot;. There he was able to finance and begin working on _The Brothers McMullen (1995)_ (qv), a comedy focusing on the trials and tribulations facing three Irish-Catholic siblings. It was shot primarily in his parents&apos; Long Island home with a cast of unknowns including Burns himself and his then-girlfriend &apos;Maxine Bahns&apos; (qv). The feature was filmed over eight months&apos; time with a reported budget of only $ 30,000. Rejected by a series of distributors, _The Brothers McMullen (1995)_ (qv) bowed at Sundance, after Burns had given &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv) a copy of the film while working on ET. In 1995 his film won the festival&apos;s Grand Jury Prize, becoming one of the most successful independent efforts of the year. He then sold the film to 20th Century Fox&apos;s Searchlight Pictures.  For his follow-up Burn&apos;s wrote and directed _She&apos;s the One (1996)_ (qv), which retained much of McMullen&apos;s cast and crew, including girlfriend Maxine. He was also able to cast up-and-coming stars &apos;Jennifer Aniston&apos; (qv) and &apos;Cameron Diaz&apos; (qv) in pivotal roles, with original music from rocker Petty, Tom. Filmed with a larger budget of almost $3 million, the romantic comedy successfully premiered during the summer of 1996 . Burns soon began work on his third feature, _No Looking Back_, a romantic drama set in a coastal town&apos;s working-class community. Burn&apos;s career seemed to be flourishing, but his personal relationship with Bahns, to whom he became engaged, ended after eight years. During filming of _No Looking Back (1998)_ (qv), there were reported romantic sightings with Burns and his co-star &apos;Lauren Holly&apos; (qv). The relationship seemed to end when the film was released in 1998. That same year, Burns co-starred in the &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) World War II epic _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). After that pivotal role in one of the greatest films of all time, Burns continued a good year, and a new relationship with &apos;Heather Graham (I)&apos; (qv). In an interview with USA Weekly Magazine, Heather stated they met in a bar in LA, exchanged numbers and had numerous conversations. Burns then flew back to New York and she flew to east to see him a month later. Soon after Burns and Heather were seen at many premieres and events. It was also reported that couple was living together. But their relationship ended after two years. Although they were dating during the filming of his next project _15 Minutes (2001)_ (qv) starring along side &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv), Burns attended the premiere with none other than &apos;Christy Turlington&apos; (qv). While his next few films did not make much of a dent in the box office including his film _Sidewalks of New York (2001)_ (qv), which co-starred Heather Graham. His relationship with Christy was getting hot and heavy. The couple got engaged in 2001. It was then reported their engagement was called off, but the couple reunited after a 7-month split. Burns and Christy finally married on June 7, 2003 and welcomed their first child Grace, later that year Grace, on October 25. Burns&apos; most recent projects include writing and directing _The Groomsmen (2006)_ (qv) and _Purple Violets (2007)_ (qv). He welcomed his second child, son Finn, (Feb/2006) with wife Christy.  Burns is committed to writing and directing his own films. He&apos;s not affected by his futile work and continues his own projects with poise. Tackling touchy relationship subjects and pioneering real-life matters. With his panoply of &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv) -like films, there is no doubt Edward Burns will continue to dazzle us with his undeniable talent while gaining the recognition he deserves as a great writer and director.</biography>

      <biography>Lasco Atkins was born in Hong Kong in 1980. At an early age he already knew he loved films, mainly action movies starring Arnie, Sly, JCVD, etc. Once at film school he learned a new appreciation for classics, black &amp; whites, 70s, etc. He re-watched old films such as Blade Runner and no longer thought of them as boring but as visual masterpieces. He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young DP&apos;s since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing, he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.</biography>

      <biography>Actor/writer/producer Todd Allen counts &apos;Gregory Peck&apos; (qv), &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv), &apos;Steve McQueen (I)&apos; (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and &apos;Robert Mitchum&apos; (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor.  Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television. He is filming the inspirational sports drama, &quot;My All American&quot; written and directed by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s blockbuster Django Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer named, &quot;Dollar Bill.&quot; In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with &apos;Robert Duvall&apos; (qv) in Duvall&apos;s Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred with Duvall again in AMC&apos;s Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _&quot;Broken Trail&quot; (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of &quot;Marshal Bill Miller,&quot; a man who carries severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan. Other career highlights include three films with &apos;Lawrence Kasdan&apos; (qv), three films with &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv), and playing fighter ace &apos;Chuck Yeager&apos; (qv) in a Hallmark Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television, including appearances on _&quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; (2000)_ (qv), _&quot;NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service&quot; (2003)_ (qv), _&quot;Monk&quot; (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv).  Allen will launch an independent media and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay, a gritty, film-noir styled Western, &quot;The Deserters&quot;, was the subject of much competition among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn&apos;t have to do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, &quot;Suicide Grip,&quot; a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. &quot;The Empty Quarter,&quot; is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well in Saudi Arabia&apos;s most barren desert and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; is based on the best selling memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger along the volatile Texas/Mexico border.  Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.</biography>

      <biography>Osment began acting at the age of four, when he tried out for a Pizza Hut commercial in a shopping mall. The commercial launched his career, and he landed his first television role later that year. As a young child, his first film role was as _Forrest Gump (1994)_ (qv)&apos;s son, also named Forrest Gump, in the 1994 film of the same name as well as making a small appearance in _Mixed Nuts (1994)_ (qv). He had roles in numerous TV series, including _&quot;Thunder Alley&quot; (1994)_ (qv), _&quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot; (1995)_ (qv), and, most notably, the final season of _&quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (1988)_ (qv), in which he replaced &apos;Dyllan Christopher&apos; (qv) as Murphy&apos;s son Avery. Osment also made numerous guest appearances in various TV series, including _&quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; (1992)_ (qv), _&quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1993)_ (qv) (as a child dying from AIDS), _&quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; (1994)_ (qv), _&quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1994)_ (qv), _&quot;The Pretender&quot; (1996)_ (qv), and as a child dying from leukemia in the emotional episode &apos;Angels and Blimps&apos; (1999) of the series _&quot;Ally McBeal&quot; (1997)_ (qv).  Osment starred in _Bogus (1996)_ (qv) with &apos;Whoopi Goldberg&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gérard Depardieu&apos; (qv), and appeared in the 1998 made-for-TV movie _The Lake (1998) (TV)_ (qv) with &apos;Yasmine Bleeth&apos; (qv), as well as _I&apos;ll Remember April (2000)_ (qv) with future _The Sixth Sense (1999)_ (qv) co-star &apos;Trevor Morgan (I)&apos; (qv). He first achieved stardom in 1999 when he appeared in the blockbuster _The Sixth Sense (1999)_ (qv), co-starring &apos;Bruce Willis&apos; (qv). For this role, Osment won the Saturn Award for best young actor. He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but lost to &apos;Michael Caine (I)&apos; (qv), with whom he would later star in _Secondhand Lions (2003)_ (qv). Osment (voice) also made three minor guest appearances on _&quot;Family Guy&quot; (1999)_ (qv) in 2000.  One of Osment&apos;s lines in _The Sixth Sense (1999)_ (qv), &quot;I see dead people,&quot; is often repeated or parodied on television programs and in other media.  The 2000 Academy Awards ceremony honored another of Osment&apos;s future co-stars, BestActor &apos;Kevin Spacey&apos; (qv), who, along with &apos;Helen Hunt (I)&apos; (qv), appeared in Osment&apos;s next film, _Pay It Forward (2000)_ (qv). The following year, Osment appeared in &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001)_ (qv), cementing his stature as one of the leading young actors in Hollywood. This role earned him his second Saturn Award. Also in 2001, Osment starred in a Polish film, _Edges of the Lord (2001)_ (qv), as Romek. The movie was never released theatrically in the United States. Osment has since provided voices for _The Country Bears (2002)_ (qv) and _The Jungle Book 2 (2003)_ (qv).  More recently, Osment was the voice of Sora, the main protagonist of the Walt Disney Company and Square-Enix&apos;s _Kingdom Hearts (2002) (VG)_ (qv) video-game series, which was extremely financially successful as well and generally well-received critically. He was also the voice of Takeshi Jinno in the &quot;Time to Shine&quot; episode of the _&quot;IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix&quot; (2005)_ (qv) animé TV series. Osment also worked in _Home of the Giants (2007)_ (qv), playing a high school journalist opposite &apos;Ryan Merriman (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Danielle Panabaker&apos; (qv). He also played Helmuth Hübener in the film _Truth &amp; Treason (????)_ (qv).  On July 20, 2006, Osment was injured in a one-car accident. His blood-alcohol content was measured at 0.16%, twice the legal limit in California. On August 18, he was charged with four misdemeanors, including driving under the influence of alcohol and possession of marijuana while driving. He pleaded no contest on October 19 and was sentenced to three years&apos; probation, 60 hours in an alcohol-rehabilitation and education program, a fine of $1,500, and a minimum requirement of 26 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings over a six-month period.</biography>

      <biography>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan&apos;s dad took up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up. He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 &apos;O&apos; Grades and 4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee. There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, &quot;Tops&quot;, and was also the &quot;Young Alan&quot; who answered readers&apos; letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed a cabaret double act with fellow student &apos;Forbes Masson&apos; (qv) called Victor and Barry, which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour), records (&quot;Hear Victor and Barry and Faint&quot;, &quot;Are We Too Loud?&quot;) and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made his professional theater and film debuts in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow and in &apos;Gillies MacKinnon&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Passing Glory&quot;. After graduating Alan worked extensively in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _&quot;Take the High Road&quot; (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when &quot;Conquest of the South Pole&quot;, a play by German playwright &apos;Manfred Karge&apos; (qv), transferred from the Traverse Theatre in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988.  Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in &quot;Accidental Death of an Anarchist&quot;, which he also adapted with director &apos;Tim Supple&apos; (qv). The production was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy Performance of the Year. Then his film career began with &apos;Ian Sellar (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Prague (1992)_ (qv), in which he starred with &apos;Sandrine Bonnaire&apos; (qv) and &apos;Bruno Ganz&apos; (qv). The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In the same year he made two films for the BBC - _&quot;Screen Two&quot; (1985) {The Last Romantics (#8.11)}_ (qv) and _Bernard and the Genie (1991) (TV)_ (qv), the latter winning him the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier awards he was also nominated for Comedy Performance of the Year for &quot;La Bete&quot;. In 1993 he played Hamlet for the English Touring Theare to great critical acclaim (&quot;An actor knocking on the door of greatness&quot; - Daily Mail; ranked first and second--with his performance in &quot;Cabaret&quot;--in the Daily Telegraph&apos;s performances of the year) and then immediately went on to play the Emcee in &apos;Sam Mendes (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the same venue (London&apos;s Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for &quot;Cabaret&quot;, and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination.  In 1994 he made his first Hollywood film, _Circle of Friends (1995)_ (qv), and his performance as the oleaginous Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (_Emma (1996)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) brought him to the attention of American producers, and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as _Romy and Michele&apos;s High School Reunion (1997)_ (qv) and _Buddy (1997)_ (qv). He returned to the UK in 1997 to work with &apos;Stanley Kubrick&apos; (qv) and the &apos;Spice Girls&apos; (qv) before returning stateside in 1998 to reprise his role in &quot;Cabaret&quot; on Broadway. The show and his portrayal were a sensation, and he received the Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics&apos; Circle, Theatre World, FANY, New York Press and New York Public Advocate&apos;s awards for his performance. Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001&apos;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; on Broadway and the hugely successful off-Broadway &quot;Elle&quot; by &apos;Jean Genet&apos; (qv), which he adapted and played the lead in 2002. Films have included &apos;Julie Taymor&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Titus (1999)_ (qv), _Urbania (2000)_ (qv), the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; trilogy, _Josie and the Pussycats (2001)_ (qv), _X2 (2003)_ (qv), _Nicholas Nickleby (2002)_ (qv), _Son of the Mask (2005)_ (qv) and the Showtime movie musical _Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005) (TV)_ (qv). He wrote, directed, produced and acted in _The Anniversary Party (2001)_ (qv) with &apos;Jennifer Jason Leigh&apos; (qv), which premiered at the Cannes Film festival in 2002 and went on to win a National Board of Review award and two Independent Spirit award nominations. More recently he has produced the documentary Show People (2004) and the films _Sweet Land (2005)_ (qv) and _Full Grown Men (2006)_ (qv) (and appears in both) and acted in _Gray Matters (2006/I)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Heather Graham (I)&apos; (qv) and _Bam Bam and Celeste (2005)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Margaret Cho&apos; (qv). in 2006 he will return to Broadway as Macheath in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. He has also found the time to write a novel, &quot;Tommy&apos;s Tale&quot;, in 2002 and a fragrance, &quot;Cumming&quot; in 2005.</biography>

      <biography>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the &quot;splatter movie&quot; explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends &apos;Dick Smith (II)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Rob Bottin&apos; (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-&apos;90s. Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor &apos;Lon Chaney&apos; (qv), and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark of Chaney&apos;s career. In Savini&apos;s insightful book &quot;Grande Illusions&quot;, he speaks of his early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using &quot;spearmint gum&quot;, having misinterpreted that he was meant to actually use &quot;spirit gum&quot;!  His first work was in low-budget fare, providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_ (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs with his grisly effects in the cult &apos;George A. Romero (I)&apos; (qv)-directed zombie film _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned &quot;splatter movie&quot; genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow (1982)_ (qv) and Romero&apos;s third &quot;Dead&quot; film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which he won a Saturn Award).  In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films, and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as &quot;Morgan, the Black Knight&quot; in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as &quot;Blades&quot;, one of the biker gang members in _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as &quot;Sex Machine&quot;, another leather-clad biker--but this time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Henry William Dalgliesh Cavill was born on the Bailiwick of Jersey, a British Crown Dependency in the Channel Islands, just off the coast of Normandy, France. He is the second youngest with four brothers.  He was educated at St. Michael&apos;s Preparatory School in Saint Saviour, Jersey before attending Stowe School in Buckinghamshire, England.  Henry&apos;s interest in acting started at an early age with school play renditions of Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream&quot;, and Sonny in &quot;Grease&quot;. He also starred and directed Hamlet in &quot;40 Minutes&quot;.  It was at the age of seventeen when Henry was discovered by casting directors at school who were looking for a young boy to play Albert Mondego in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (2002). He went on to star in &quot;Laguna&quot; (2001), appear in BBC&apos;s &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot; (2002), TV film &quot;Goodbye Mr Chips&quot; (2002), and TV series &quot;Midsummer Murders&quot; (2003).  From 2003 when Henry was twenty years old, he gained starring roles in &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; (2003), &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot; (2007), &quot;Hellraiser: Hellworld&quot; (2005), and &quot;Tristan &amp; Isolde&quot; (2006). He also had a minor role in &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007) alongside Sienna Miller and Ben Barnes.  From 2007-2010, Henry had a leading role in TV series &quot;The Tudors&quot; as Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. The series was a hit and was nominated for a Golden Globe in 2007 and won an Emmy in 2008. Entertainment Weekly named him &apos;Most Dashing Duke&apos;.  He also starred in &quot;Blood Creek&quot; (2009) and Woody Allen&apos;s comedy film &quot;Whatever Works&quot; (2009).  Once TV hit series &quot;The Tudors&quot; ended, Henry played lead roles in Tarsem Singh&apos;s mythological special effects film &quot;Immortals&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Cold Light of Day&quot; (2012) alongside Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver.

      <birthDateAsString>29 November 1961</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Jr., Thomas Edward Sizemore</birthName>
      <biography>Tom Sizemore rose in prominence throughout the 1990s, establishing himself as a memorable tough-guy character, sought by the most respected directors in the business. Born in Detroit on November 29, 1961, Sizemore grew up idolizing the tough-guy characters of the movies he watched. After attending Wayne State University, he got his master&apos;s degree in theatre from Temple University in 1986.  Like many, he moved to New York City and struggled, waiting tables and performing in plays. His first break came when &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv) cast him in a bit part in _Born on the Fourth of July (1989)_ (qv). Bigger roles soon followed throughout the early 1990s, such as _Guilty by Suspicion (1991)_ (qv), _True Romance (1993)_ (qv), and _Striking Distance (1993)_ (qv). 1994 proved to be an even bigger year for Sizemore, as he won the role of &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; in &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv)&apos;s star-studded biopic _Wyatt Earp (1994)_ (qv), as well as one of his first truly memorable roles as &quot;Detective Jack Scagnetti&quot; in &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s controversial _Natural Born Killers (1994)_ (qv). In 1995 he appeared in _Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)_ (qv), _Strange Days (1995)_ (qv), as well as the acclaimed crime epic _Heat (1995)_ (qv), directed by &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv). Sizemore&apos;s first big leading role is in _The Relic (1997)_ (qv), the big-budget effects thriller directed by &apos;Peter Hyams&apos; (qv).  According to a 2001 interview in The Calgary Sun, Sizemore entered a drug rehabilitation program in 1998 after his mother and his friend &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv) appeared on his door-step during the filming of _Witness to the Mob (1998) (TV)_ (qv). Telling him they were there to drive him to jail or to rehabilitation, Sizemore chose the latter. After completing rehabilitation, he counseled adolescents involved in substance abuse.  Offered roles in W.W.II films directed by both &apos;Terrence Malick&apos; (qv) and &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv), Sizemore chose the role of &quot;Sergeant Horvath&quot; in _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). The role and film received wide acclaim and introduced Sizemore&apos;s talents to a much broader audience in a more human and well-rounded role than he had previously been given. Sizemore also credits this shoot and &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) for helping him with his recovery from addiction, with &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) threatening to reshoot the entire film if Sizemore failed a drug test even once.  After a flamboyant and uncredited mobster role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv), Sizemore then portrayed a psychotic paramedic in _Bringing Out the Dead (1999)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv). Seemingly taking it easy, he then turned in fine but stereotypical performances in _Play It to the Bone (1999)_ (qv), _Red Planet (2000)_ (qv), and _Pearl Harbor (2001)_ (qv). Sizemore then received another leading role in the high-profile military drama _Black Hawk Down (2001)_ (qv) directed by yet another legendary director, &apos;Ridley Scott&apos; (qv).  Specializing in the sort of ultimate tough-guy/manly man roles that hearken back to a different era in film, Sizemore continues to be a favourite of Hollywood&apos;s greatest directors. Never afraid to speak his mind about anyone and anything, his sense of blunt honesty and lack of pretension is refreshing. A commanding voice and presence on film, Sizemore looks to continue as one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest actors.</biography>

      <biography>Son of a Cotroni mafia gangster/government rebel/veteran soldier of WWII and Indochina. Nicky Naudé&apos;s father, half-French, half-Italian, escaped to Mexico after robbing a bank, where his wife (Nicky&apos;s mother) became a successful model and actress. After a few years they fled to Montreal in Canada, where Nicky was born. His dad managed a club called &quot;Chez Clairette&apos;&apos;, often spending time there with Jacques Mesrine. The club was owned by the infamous Cotroni, the Canadian Al Capone. After about 15 years in Canada, Nicky and his mother returned to France, joined a year later by his dad. A new, quiet life left his parents discontent, which led to alcoholism. Nicky was orphaned at the age of 17.  Nicky&apos;s destiny was to be very different, thanks in large part to his involvement in sports, training in Full Contact - American kick-boxing and Kung Fu. Very early he became the French and European junior champion. A career as a fashion model followed, with Nicky relocating to New York, London, Tokyo, Barcelona and Amsterdam; then as an actor, featuring in blockbuster films such as The Bourne Identity, Hitman, Brotherhood of the Wolf and Arsene Lupin.</biography>

      <akaNames class="linked-list"/>
      <gender>FEMALE</gender>
      <birthDateAsString>10 March 1978</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Originally from a tourist town in Canada, Cardinal was shuffled around until she ended up in foster care. At 12 years old, she co-founded a peer counseling organization dedicated to assisting children suffering from sexual abuse. By 16 she&apos;d decided to move to the US to live the American dream, working 3 jobs to make ends meet. At 19, misdiagnosed with cancer and only holding a grade 7 education, she turned her life around, went back to school and earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in Psychology on full scholarship. A natural leader, she was unanimously elected president of the theatre club and held that position until she graduated. It was then she knew the movie business was the only place for her. Still in school and working a full time corporate job, she booked the female lead in the Warner Brother&apos;s slasher flick &quot;Delivery&quot;. Soon, other offers came in. While juggling a budding film career, University and a full time job, she honed her improv skills at the Florida Renaissance Festival. Her first year performing as a man, because the festival director wouldn&apos;t let her sword fight as a woman.  A few films later, Cardinal combined the skills she&apos;d learned at her corporate job, her love of the Renaissance and sword play, and her name as an up and comer to create &quot;Legend of the Red Reaper&quot;. Seasoned pros and aspirings alike flocked to her side and the project took on a life of its own. No sooner was production underway than adversity came with it. Midway through filming, a co-production company embezzled 40% of the production funds - but Tara used her credit, her savings, and finally her own home to make up the difference. But it wasn&apos;t enough, and all of her above the line crew quit when the money ran out. Cardinal taught herself screen writing, submitted her body to a 4 month invasive medical study and became a professional wrestler to raise the money to finish the shoot. With no other producers on set, she promoted all of her department heads to producer and went on to direct and produce, while staring in the film. Her cast and crew stood by her side and the film was finished within months. Post production offered a new set of challenges. Over 120 minutes of footage was lost by a shady post house. Three editors failed to complete so much as a rough cut. One distribution company tried to extort the film from Cardinal, trying to use her hard won film as b-roll and putting Steven Segal in the lead. Cardinal held her ground and her movie, even when the big shots threatened to sue.  Finally, she caught the attention of movie mogul Uwe Boll, who took one look at the assembly her third editor compiled - and unfortunately passed.  Resolute, she made him a deal. If she edited a new cut, would he reconsider? He would and she did. But first, she had to learn how to edit. When Uwe Boll saw her cut, he decided on the spot to not only rep the movie, but to throw his full weight behind the project, bringing on an award winning post production team. Helmed by Cardinal, the movie was recut, colored and scored to reflect a new vision. As Cardinal evolved, so did the film. Cardinal polished the film with a personal narration, bringing the final product together as one cohesive unit.  In the midst of finishing Red Reaper, another project fell into her lap. Half finished, with 9 of 19 reels destroyed in a freak Fed-Ex accident, Cardinal put her skills to work, re-writing, re-casting, and re-shooting &quot;Scarlet Samurai&quot; (which originally went by the title &quot;Terminal Descent&quot;). Cardinal based the lead character on her martial arts master Sean Wyn, who trained her in both the physical and spiritual martial arts, creating a part Asian, part Jewish (lesbian) superhero infused with powers by her training in Buddhism. Cardinal not only stars as the samurai in training, but plays her own twin. She also co-edited both sound and picture, audio-mixed, color graded and did some of the visual effects.  In addition to creating two feature films, Cardinal also co-authored a novel based on the Red Reaper characters with fantasy novelist Alex Bledsoe. She is in talks to do a short run comic series for both properties and released an ashcan version of Red Reaper, featuring the art of George Perez at San Diego Comicon. She continues to accept roles in movies of all genres and her spare time gathers her celebrity friends for charity events at Dark Delicacies in Burbank. Since moving to Hollywood, California she has raised over $10,000 for charity to relieve the Tsunami victims in Japan, the earthquake victims in Haiti and Chile, Homeless youth and abandoned dogs in Los Angeles.  She currently resides in Hollywood California where she is catching up on some much needed sleep in between producing charity events, writing novels and comic books, and creating superheros.</biography>

      <birthName>Willis, Walter Bruce</birthName>
      <biography>Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for his film appearances as wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts. Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in West Germany, to an American father and a German mother, who were living on a United States military base. He was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly &quot;discovered&quot; whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.  After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye &quot;David Addison&quot; alongside sultry &apos;Cybill Shepherd&apos; (qv) in the hit romantic comedy television series _&quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985)_ (qv). The series firmly established Bruce Willis as a hot new talent, and his sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. was in effect a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective &quot;John McClane&quot; in the monster hit _Die Hard (1988)_ (qv). This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis&apos; character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Willis reprized the role of tough guy cop &quot;John McClane&quot; in the eagerly anticipated sequel _Die Hard 2 (1990)_ (qv) set at snowbound Washington&apos;s Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel _Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)_ (qv) this time also starring &apos;Samuel L. Jackson&apos; (qv) as a cynical Harlem shopowner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in NYC.  Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of &quot;Mikey&quot; the baby in the very popular family comedies _Look Who&apos;s Talking (1989)_ (qv), and its sequel _Look Who&apos;s Talking Too (1990)_ (qv) also starring &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Kirstie Alley&apos; (qv). Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. _The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)_ (qv) and _Hudson Hawk (1991)_ (qv) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyperviolent _The Last Boy Scout (1991)_ (qv), the darkly humored _Death Becomes Her (1992)_ (qv) and the mediocre police thriller _Striking Distance (1993)_ (qv). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing _North (1994)_ (qv), as a cagey prizefighter in the &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) directed mega-hit _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv), the &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv) directed apocalyptic thriller _Twelve Monkeys (1995)_ (qv), the &apos;Luc Besson&apos; (qv) directed sci-fi opus _The Fifth Element (1997)_ (qv) and the &apos;M. Night Shyamalan&apos; (qv) directed spine-tingling epic _The Sixth Sense (1999)_ (qv).  Willis next starred in the gangster comedy _The Whole Nine Yards (2000)_ (qv), worked again with &quot;hot&quot; director &apos;M. Night Shyamalan&apos; (qv) in the less gripping _Unbreakable (2000)_ (qv), and in two military dramas, _Hart&apos;s War (2002)_ (qv) and _Tears of the Sun (2003)_ (qv) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded &apos;Frank Miller (II)&apos; (qv) graphic novel turned movie _Sin City (2005)_ (qv), the voice of &quot;RJ&quot; the scheming raccoon in the animated hit _Over the Hedge (2006)_ (qv) and &quot;Die Hard&quot; fans rejoiced to see &quot;John McClane&quot; return to the big screen in the high tech _Live Free or Die Hard (2007)_ (qv) aka &quot;Die Hard 4.0&quot;.  Willis was married to actress &apos;Demi Moore&apos; (qv) for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three children.</biography>

      <biography>Canadian-born actor Nathan Fillion gained critical acclaim and a large cult of fans when he starred as Captain Malcolm Reynolds on the &apos;Joss Whedon&apos; (qv) TV series _&quot;Firefly&quot; (2002)_ (qv), having previously been a regular on _&quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1968)_ (qv) and _&quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot; (1998)_ (qv). Fillion had also appeared in small roles in the films _Blast from the Past (1999)_ (qv) and _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv).  Whedon gave Fillion a chance to display his range when he cast Fillion as the twisted preacher Caleb, a villain, in the seventh and final season of _&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997)_ (qv).  When _&quot;Firefly&quot; (2002)_ (qv) was prematurely canceled in late 2002, the show&apos;s cast, crew, and many fans were devastated. Whedon vowed to resurrect the series in some way, and Fillion played Captain Reynolds again in the feature-film _Serenity (2005)_ (qv). Fillion followed this film with more big screen leading roles in the horror-comedy _Slither (2006)_ (qv) and the indie hit _Waitress (2007)_ (qv). He also continued to be a force in television, starring in the short-lived Fox-TV series _&quot;Drive&quot; (2007)_ (qv) and appearing on ABC&apos;s _&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004)_ (qv). He took his first singing part (and cemented his cult appeal) as Captain Hammer in Whedon&apos;s musical Internet smash _&quot;Dr. Horrible&apos;s Sing-Along Blog&quot; (2008)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Actor Simon Kunz was born on 8 May 1954, the same year that his American-born, England domiciled grandfather, the pianist Charlie Kunz, had a Top Twenty hit with Piano Medley 114. After leaving the Latymer School Simon read Theatre Studies at Warwick University and in 1984 became the drummer in the band the Locomotives. However, rather than follow Charlie into the music business he left the group after a year to concentrate on acting. On stage he appeared with the National Theatre (Brackenbury in &apos;Richard III&apos;), the Oxford Stage Company (Oliver in &apos;As You Like It&apos;, Edgar in &apos;King Lear&apos;)in &apos;The Caretaker&apos; at the Bristol Old Vic, &apos;Live Like Pigs&apos; at the Royal Court and &apos;The Park&apos; with the Royal Shakespeare Company, making his film debut in &apos;Four Weddings and a Funeral&apos;. On television he has appeared in most of the populist dramas where he seems to have played rather more than his fair share of policemen - of all ranks - and lawyers.</biography>

      <birthName>Cavett, Richard Alva</birthName>
      <biography>Yale-educated Dick Cavett established his reputation as the most erudite of American talk show hosts in the late 1960s and early &apos;70s. Although there were many contenders who took on &apos;Johnny Carson (I)&apos; qv, the undisputed heavyweight champion of late-night TV, Cavett generally was considered the most successful of the pretenders to Carson&apos;s throne. There were many challengers, and Carson vanquished them all, most notably &apos;Joey Bishop (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Jerry Lewis (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Merv Griffin&apos; (qv) (who moved his talk show to afternoons and syndication after it was canceled by CBS in 1972 after a three year run on the network).  Cavett&apos;s late-night talk show ran on ABC ran from 1968 to 1974, and then for an additional year on CBS. (He has since appeared on numerous other talk show gigs into the 21st Century.) Thought it ranked third in ratings behind Carson (perpetually #1 for all the years he headlined his own show) and Griffin in 1969-72, he was the most respected of the Carson-wannabes. Cavett was famous for attracting guests who normally did not appear on talk shows, such as &apos;Katharine Hepburn&apos; (qv), &apos;Laurence Olivier&apos; (qv) and the post-&quot;Godfather&quot; &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv), who used his time on the &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot; to talk about Indians rights with Native American spokespeople Cavett allowed to share Brando&apos;s forum. The reticent Brando praised Cavett for being the best.  &quot;The King of Late Night&quot; and the highest-paid television personality of his time, Johnny Carson eventually crushed even Dick Cavett. Ironically, Cavett was born in Nebraska and was an aspiring amateur magician, as was fellow Cornhusker Carson, for whom Cavett worked on _&quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; (1962)_ (qv) as a writer after having broken in to the business in a similar capacity for &apos;Jack Paar (I)&apos; (qv), Carson&apos;s predecessor on &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot;  He was born Richard Alva Cavett on November 19, 1936, in Gibbon, Nebraska, the son of two educators. After spending his childhood in Lincoln, Nebraska, he matriculated at Yale, where he first experienced the debilitating depression caused by bipolar disorder that would plague him though his adult life. He switched his major at Yale to drama and, upon graduating, made the rounds of casting agents, as did his first wife, the actress &apos;Carrie Nye&apos; (qv) whom he married in 1964 and remained married to for 42 years, until her death.  At 5&apos;3&quot; tall, Cavett was too short to be a success at anything but character parts, but even those were not forthcoming. In addition to his writing for Paar and Carson (and a high-priced staff writing gig on the notoriously unsuccessful _&quot;The Jerry Lewis Show&quot; (1963)_ (qv) in 1963, after which he returned to Carson after Lewis bombed and was canceled), Cavett launched a career as a stand-up comic, possibly influenced by &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv), whom he discovered for Paar (his title on Jack Paar&apos;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; was (&quot;talent coordinator&quot;).  An American treasure, Dick Cavett now writes regularly for &quot;The New York Times.&quot; In November 2010, he had married for the second time, tying the knot with writer Martha Rogers in New Orleans.</biography>

      <biography>Jennifer Garner, who has catapulted into stardom with her lead role on the television series _&quot;Alias&quot; (2001)_ (qv), has come a long way from her birthplace of Houston, Texas. Raised in Charleston, West Virginia by her mother Pat, a retired English teacher, and her father, Bill, a former chemical engineer, Jennifer was the middle sibling of three girls. She spent nine years of her adolescence studying ballet and describes her years in dance as ones characterized by determination rather than talent, being driven mostly by a love of the stage.  Jennifer took this determination with her when she enrolled at Denison University as a chemistry major, a decision that was later changed to a drama major when she found that her passions for the stage were stronger than her love of science. New York attracted the young actress after college where she worked as a hostess while pursuing a career in film and television. Her most recent move has been to Los Angeles, a decision that led to a role on the television series _&quot;Felicity&quot; (1998)_ (qv), where she met her future husband &apos;Scott Foley (I)&apos; (qv). The couple divorced in 2004.  Jennifer appears on television as Agent Sydney Bristow, who works for the Central Intelligence Agency. For her work, Garner has received four consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She has also received four Golden Globe nominations and won once, as well as received two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and won once. She has appeared in numerous other television production as well as such films as _Elektra (2005)_ (qv), _13 Going on 30 (2004)_ (qv), _Daredevil (2003)_ (qv), _Pearl Harbor (2001)_ (qv) and _Dude, Where&apos;s My Car? (2000)_ (qv). Aside from filming _&quot;Alias&quot; (2001)_ (qv), Jennifer enjoys cooking, gardening, hiking, and inspired by her character on the series, kickboxing.</biography>

      <biography>Richard was the middle of three sons born to Edward, a real estate lawyer, and Charlotte, a cable TV and publishing executive. His parents divorced when he was 12. He dropped out of high school but obtained an equivalency diploma. He tried studying at the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1973, but had no interest. After not bothering to show up for finals, he headed to Colorado where he cut firewood and lived a hippie life. He returned to New York in 1975 and started studying acting at CCNY and eventually was accepted into their theater program. He initially disliked acting and studied to be a director. He directed several off-Broadway plays, including &quot;Antigone&quot; with a then just-graduated &apos;Angela Bassett&apos; (qv) in 1983. He also met present wife, &apos;Sheila Kelley (I)&apos; (qv), during auditions for this play. The two married in 1996. In the mid-1980s, Richard says he conquered his fears and decided to take a stab at acting. He got several TV roles, but he was seen by &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) in an episode of the TV drama _&quot;High Incident&quot; (1996)_ (qv). Speilberg then cast him in _The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)_ (qv) and his career has been on an upward climb ever since that has lead to his co-starring role in _&quot;The West Wing&quot; (1999)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Presnell, George Harvey</birthName>
      <biography>By the time handsome, brawny baritone Harve Presnell arrived on the film scene, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of musicals had long dissipated. Born in Modesto, California in 1933, he graduated from Modesto High School and received a USC sports scholarship, but moved quickly to singing. Initially training for an operatic career, he spent three seasons singing throughout Europe. He was performing nationally, however, when the opportunity for Broadway first came his way. Legendary composer &apos;Meredith Willson&apos; (qv) happened to catch an earful of the gifted singer in concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and, in the virile mold of &apos;Alfred Drake&apos; (qv) and &apos;Howard Keel&apos; (qv), wrote the role of Johnny &quot;Leadville&quot; Brown in &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; specifically for him. The Broadway musical, with &apos;Tammy Grimes&apos; (qv) as the spunky title heroine, was a resounding hit as Harve wrapped his glorious tonsils around such sturdy, wide-stanced songs as &quot;Colorado, My Home&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ll Never Say No.&quot; Unlike Grimes, Presnell was granted the opportunity to recreate his rags-to-riches part when the celluloid version of _The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964)_ (qv) came out with a bankable film star, the indomitable &apos;Debbie Reynolds (I)&apos; (qv), inhabiting the backwoods role. The film version was also hugely popular with audiences and Harve, with his terrific presence. seemed well on his way to stardom.  There were precious few movie musicals, however, for Presnell to sink his teeth into and he quickly faded from view. He tried adjusting to straight dramatics with the rugged western _The Glory Guys (1965)_ (qv) and sang again in the highly unworthy teen frolic _When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965)_ (qv) with &apos;Connie Francis&apos; (qv), but little else came in his direction. The disastrous film version of _Paint Your Wagon (1969)_ (qv), hurt by the miscasting of leads &apos;Lee Marvin (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jean Seberg&apos; (qv), was redeemed only by the presence of Presnell and his superb, moving rendition of &quot;They Call the Wind Mariah&quot;.  By the 70s Harve was finished in films but gamely kept his momentum with Keel-like stock and touring leads in such productions as &quot;Camelot,&quot; &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,&quot; among others. He even played Rhett Butler in a 1972 musical version of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; at London&apos;s Drury Lane Theatre, but the production did not generate much of a stir. In 1979, Presnell served as a replacement in the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot; as Daddy Warbucks and wound up staying employed as the blustery but big-hearted moneybags for nearly 4 years on tour, also reprising the role in the failed 90s sequel &quot;Annie II: Miss Hannigan&apos;s Revenge&quot; (1989), which was later reworked and retitled &quot;Annie Warbucks&quot; (1992). All tolled, it is estimated that Harve played the tycoon role over 2,000 times.  More than 25 years had passed by the time Presnell returned to the movies as a brash and balding character actor. He struck pure gold as the implacable, ill-fated father-in-law of &apos;William H. Macy&apos; (qv) in the Coen Brothers&apos; cult film hit _Fargo (1996)_ (qv). This success, in turn, led to meaty roles in _Larger Than Life (1996)_ (qv), _The Whole Wide World (1996)_ (qv), _The Chamber (1996)_ (qv), _Face/Off (1997)_ (qv), _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv) and _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), to name a few. Over the course of his career, he displayed a strong presence on TV as well with recurring roles on prime-time (&quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;) and daytime (&quot;Ryan&apos;s Hope&quot;). Presnell may have been born 10-20 years too late to have become a singing film star, but he suddenly had come back in spades to launch a whole new career as a noted character performer. At age 70+ he was unsinkable, vigorously steamrolling on TV (&quot;The Pretender,&quot; &quot;The Monk&quot; and &quot;ER&quot;) and in the films _Mr. Deeds (2002)_ (qv), _Old School (2003)_ (qv), _Flags of Our Fathers (2006)_ (qv) and _Evan Almighty (2007)_ (qv). His last series role was in the short-lived _&quot;Andy Barker, P.I.&quot; (2007)_ (qv).  Pancreatic cancer got the best of the actor in his final years. The twice-married actor with six children (Stephanie, Taylor, Etoile, Tulley, Shannon and Raine) succumbed to his illness at the St. John&apos;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California on June 30, 2009, at age 76.</biography>

      <biography>Richard Roundtree was a leading man in many &quot;blaxploitation&quot; movies in the 1970s. He is best known for his role as John Shaft in _Shaft (1971)_ (qv), and starred in its two sequels as well. As the 1970s and 1980s progressed he starred more in low-budget movies. He was in a few occasional high-profile, if a tad offbeat, films. Among his more notable work in that period were _Escape to Athena (1979)_ (qv), _City Heat (1984)_ (qv) and the socially conscious but badly received _Game for Vultures (1979)_ (qv). Roundtree has been active in movies these days. He became popular again in the 1990s with his role in _Se7en (1995)_ (qv), and was well received for reprising his role as the classic hero, and &apos;Samuel L. Jackson&apos; (qv)&apos;s uncle, in the 2000 remake of the film that made him a star, _Shaft (2000)_ (qv).</biography>

Her mother, &apos;Marlène Jobert&apos; (qv), is an actress who retired from acting and became a writer of children&apos;s books. Eva&apos;s mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva&apos;s father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University.  She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: &quot;La Jalousie en Trois Fax&quot; and &quot;Turcaret&quot;. There she caught the eye of director &apos;Bernardo Bertolucci&apos; (qv). Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with &apos;Bernardo Bertolucci&apos; (qv). During their work Bertolucci described Green as being &quot;so beautiful it&apos;s indecent.&quot; Green won critical acclaim for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score.  After The Dreamers Green&apos;s career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer _Arsène Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Romain Duris&apos; (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite &apos;Orlando Bloom&apos; (qv) and &apos;Liam Neeson&apos; (qv) in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by &apos;Ridley Scott&apos; (qv). The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in The Black Dahlia that went to &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv) because she didn&apos;t want to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead, Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl after &apos;Claudine Auger&apos; (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), &apos;Corinne Cléry (I)&apos; (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), &apos;Carole Bouquet&apos; (qv) in _For Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and &apos;Sophie Marceau&apos; (qv) in The World is not enough (1999).  Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can&apos;t speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.</biography>

      <birthName>Gill, Jimmy Lee</birthName>
      <biography>His legal name is Jimmy Lee Gill. His professional name is Seth Bailey. He has been a performing clown almost his entire life.  Early 1950&apos;s, as a pre-school child Jimmy&apos;s Grandfather, the former world renowned circus clown Seth Walter Bailey also and better known as &quot;Bill Bailey&quot; would make-up and costumed Jimmy as a clown then take the miniature clown along on gigs.  Late 1960&apos;s, Jimmy began his professional career at the age of 16 with summer employment at the Memphis Zoological Garden as a clown for its daily one-ring circus. Tommy O&apos;Brian, the former world renowned circus animal trainer, directed this two-shows-a-day gig. Jimmy used Grandpa Bailey&apos;s make-up kit and costume. He did a bald Whiteface 2-piece clown suit and tie entity.  Early 1970&apos;s, Jimmy became a member of the Al Chymia Shriners&apos; Clown Unit in Memphis, Tennessee. He continued to use Grandpa Bailey&apos;s make-up kit and costume. He did a red mop wigged Whiteface ragged Andy type entity. All of the Clown Unit&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes. One May they dressed for 20 events. One Memorial Day weekend, they raised over $6,500 for the &quot;Muscular Dystrophy Association&apos;s Telethon&quot; by collecting change from passing motorists at a major Memphis street intersection.  Late 1980&apos;s, Jimmy became a member of the Woodland Hills Shriners&apos; Clown Club in Los Angeles, California. He now had his own much larger make-up kit and a couple of his own costumes. He introduced two new personal clown entities: Hobo 01 and Auguste 04. All of this Clown Club&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes. They regularly visited nursing homes to entertained seniors. They also dressed for as many holiday parades as possible and children&apos;s causes such as the &quot;Juvenile Diabetes Foundation&quot;.  Early 1990&apos;s, Jimmy co-founded and became a charter member of the Al Malaikah Shriners&apos; Clown Unit in Los Angeles, California. He continued doing Hobo 01 and Auguste 04 while developing three new personal clown entities: Tramp 02, Auguste 03 and Whiteface 05. All of the Clown Unit&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes including weekly visited the Shriners&apos; Hospital for Children.  Mid 1990&apos;s, responding to numerous requests, Jimmy began to voluntarily teach clowning skills to non-profit groups: churches, community recreational centers, fraternities, etc. During this endeavor, he had the pleasure of creating an unknown number of clown entities for others of all ages, children to seniors. Each of these clown troops furthered local charities as their purpose.  Late 1997, One of Jimmy&apos;s former clown students, AEA/AFTRA/AGVA/SAG member &apos;Sherri McKenzie&apos; (qv), recommended him to a Casting Director for a role as a clown in the feature film remake titled _Carnival of Souls (1998)_ (qv). He was booked and worked that project as Hobo 01. He found this new creative outlet quite thrilling, desired more of it and pursued it with new found passion.  Early 1998, Jimmy became a member of AFTRA and SAG. Since then, he&apos;s worked under the jurisdiction of both unions on being called. He continued to do Hobo 01, Tramp 02, Auguste 03, Auguste 04 and Whiteface 05 while developing four new personal clown entities: Whiteface 06, Mime 07, Character 08 and Character 09. Jimmy now adopted the professional name of Seth Bailey to honor Grandpa Bailey, from whence his roots grow. By virtue of his work Jimmy&apos;s earned eligibility to join AEA.  Late 1998, Jimmy was asked if he could duplicate John Wayne Gacy&apos;s &quot;Pogo the Clown&quot; entity for the feature television film titled _Men in White (1998) (TV)_ (qv). An Internet search provided a color image of Gacy&apos;s sinister clown entity which Jimmy did duplicate as requested.  Early 2000, Jimmy volunteered to help the &quot;Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Los Angeles&quot; grant a terminally ill young boy&apos;s wish of having a clown host his birthday party. Jimmy worked the party of family and friends as Auguste 03 with: balloon sculptures, comedic stich, face painting, juggling, and magic (both stage and close-up). Efern&apos;s face beamed joy and his excitement was contagious! This sadly, turned out to be Efern&apos;s last birthday as he succumbed to leukemia. Jimmy&apos;s still on-call for Make-A-Wish.  Mid 2000, Jimmy&apos;s voluntarily worked several fund-raisers for the &quot;Starlight Children&apos;s Foundation&quot;. Jimmy&apos;s also still on-call for Starlight.  Jimmy continues working gigs for charitable causes, AFTRA and SAG. He now additionally offers his services for corporate events, i.e. a specially designed iconic entity, spokesman, grand openings, annual parties, etc. He has worked one Hollywood Studio Producer&apos;s Christmas Party as Mime 07. He is a professional clown in both appearance and entertainment quality.</biography>

      <birthName>Stiles, Julia O&apos;Hara</birthName>
      <biography>Julia O&apos;Hara Stiles was born on March 28, 1981 in New York City, the outgoing daughter of an elementary school teacher father and a Greenwich Village artist mother, and the eldest of three children. Encouraged to take modern dance lessons at an early age, she was introduced to Shakespeare and theater. At age 11, she made her debut as a child actress with the experimental off-Broadway La MaMa Theatre. Her passion grew and by the next year was performing professionally and working in commercials. A bright, precocious student, she was seriously considered for the child vampire role of Claudia in _Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)_ (qv) but lost out in the end to &apos;Kirsten Dunst&apos; (qv). She continued training at New York&apos;s Professional Children&apos;s School and, at 15, made her cinematic bow with _I Love You, I Love You Not (1996)_ (qv) with &apos;Claire Danes&apos; (qv). Next featured as the daughter of &apos;Harrison Ford (I)&apos; (qv) in _The Devil&apos;s Own (1997)_ (qv), her breakout role came on TV with the hard-hitting mini-movie _Before Women Had Wings (1997) (TV)_ (qv), which was produced by &apos;Oprah Winfrey&apos; (qv) and dealt with child abuse. Her wish to play Shakespeare was granted threefold with her participation in _10 Things I Hate About You (1999)_ (qv), which was based on the Bard&apos;s &quot;The Taming of The Shrew&quot; and won her the Chicago Film Critics Award as the volatile teen Kat; an updated version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) which paired her Ophelia with &apos;Ethan Hawke&apos; (qv); and another updated version of &quot;Othello&quot; entitled _O (2001)_ (qv), which had her high school character of Desi (Desdemona) involved in a mixed romantic relationship with African-American &apos;Mekhi Phifer&apos; (qv). The violent-edged film was made in 1998 but not released until three years later due to the tragic Colorado student shootings at Columbine High School. In addition, Julia later portrayed Viola off-Broadway in a Shakespeare-in-the-Park production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in 2002.  She temporarily interrupted her career after deciding to enroll at Columbia University in 2000, where she earned a degree in English. Stiles has also returned to the stage, appearing in &apos;David Mamet (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Oleanna&quot; in London, a role she would reprise on Broadway in 2009, opposite &apos;Bill Pullman&apos; (qv) and directed by &apos;Doug Hughes (IV)&apos; (qv). Moving into mainstream roles by the millennium, she took on a role that would carry her through the decade, co-starring with &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv) in popular Bourne series: _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv), and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv). During the time between Bourne films, she appeared in ensemble dramas, appearing opposite &apos;Julia Roberts (I)&apos; (qv) in _Mona Lisa Smile (2003)_ (qv), won offbeat notice in the title role of _Carolina (2003/I)_ (qv) with &apos;Shirley MacLaine&apos; (qv) and &apos;Randy Quaid&apos; (qv). She also returned to her indie film roots, with films such as _Between Us (2012)_ (qv) and the comedy farce, _It&apos;s a Disaster (2012)_ (qv).  In 2010, she switched gears and headed to series television, joining the cast of _&quot;Dexter&quot; (2006)_ (qv) for the show&apos;s fifth season in the role of Lumen Pierce, a performance that earned her nominations for both the Golden Globe and the Emmy for Best Supporting Actress. In 2012, she followed up with another series, _&quot;Blue&quot; (2012)_ (qv), which airs on YouTube, while preparing for cinematic roles in _Silver Linings Playbook (2012)_ (qv) and _The Bell Jar (????)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Butler, Gerard James</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Paisley, Scotland, to Margaret and Edward Butler, Gerard Butler was raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley, Scotland. He also spent some of his youth in Canada. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school&apos;s law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.  His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor &apos;Steven Berkoff (I)&apos; (qv), who later appeared alongside Butler in _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv), who gave him a role in a stage production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as &apos;Ewan McGregor&apos; (qv)&apos;s character &quot;Renton&quot; in the stage adaptation of [i]Trainspotting[/i]. His film debut was as &apos;Billy Connolly (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s younger brother in _Mrs Brown (1997)_ (qv). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.  His film career continued with small roles, first in the &quot;James Bond&quot; movie, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv), and then &apos;Russell Mulcahy&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Tale of the Mummy (1998)_ (qv). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being &quot;Attila the Hun&quot; in the USA Network mini-series, _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv). The film&apos;s producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler&apos;s screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time &quot;Attila&quot; was being filmed, casting was in progress for &apos;Wes Craven&apos; (qv)&apos;s new take on the &quot;Dracula&quot; legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn&apos;t much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of &quot;Attila&quot;. Evidently, they saw something because _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila&apos;s producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film&apos;s ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, an Internet site and began appearing on lists everywhere.  Since then, he has appeared in _Reign of Fire (2002)_ (qv) as &quot;Creedy&quot; and _Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003)_ (qv) as &quot;Terry Sheridan&quot;, alongside &apos;Angelina Jolie&apos; (qv). The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of &quot;Andre Marek&quot; in the big-screen adaptation of &apos;Michael Crichton&apos; (qv)&apos;s novel, _Timeline (2003)_ (qv). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in &apos;Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos; (qv)&apos;s musical, _The Phantom of the Opera (2004)_ (qv), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention. Other projects include _Dear Frankie (2004)_ (qv), _The Game of Their Lives (2005)_ (qv) and _Beowulf &amp; Grendel (2005)_ (qv).  In 2007, he starred as Spartan &quot;King Leonidas&quot; in the Warner Bros. production _300 (2006)_ (qv), based on the &apos;Frank Miller (II)&apos; (qv) graphic novel, and _Butterfly on a Wheel (2007)_ (qv), co-starring &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv) and &apos;Maria Bello&apos; (qv), which aired on network TV under the title, &quot;Shattered&quot;. He most recently starred in _P.S. I Love You (2007)_ (qv), with Academy Award-winner &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv).  In 2007, he appeared in _Nim&apos;s Island (2008)_ (qv) and _RocknRolla (2008)_ (qv), and completed the new &apos;Mark Neveldine&apos; (qv) / &apos;Brian Taylor (V)&apos; (qv) film, _Gamer (2009)_ (qv). His next films included _The Ugly Truth (2009)_ (qv), co-starring &apos;Katherine Heigl&apos; (qv), which began filming in April 2008, _The Bounty Hunter (2010/I)_ (qv), _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), _Chasing Mavericks (2012)_ (qv) and _Olympus Has Fallen (2013)_ (qv). Butler is also a relative of rising animator and film director &apos;Mark Flood (III)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Takara was born the youngest of 2 in Washington, DC. She never had an interest in politics so she spent the majority of her adolescence a student athlete, with quixotic dreams of being an Olympic gymnast and lawyer.  Takara got her first taste of the stage as &quot;Orchid&quot; in her school&apos;s production of Rose Petal&apos;s Place at the age of 7. However, the idea of being an actor was not in her sights. In fact, she was shy and dreaded being in front of audiences and her &quot;gripping performance&quot; did not change her disposition.  It wasn&apos;t until she performed a short skit in her high school social studies class where she realized she was on to something. Immediately after that class, the instructor encouraged Takara to register for her Drama class the next semester. She spent the remainder of her time in high school exploring the arts and discovered she had a knack for the performing arts.  Spending less than a year in the work force, after graduating college, Takara decided she would move to Atlanta, GA to try to make it as an actress. Since her move she has been blazing a trail through Atlanta&apos;s arts community in Film, Television, and Theatre. Most recently, the City of Atlanta awarded Takara the Emerging Artist Award in Media Arts.  In addition to acting, Takara is hard at work developing her production company and producing a web series she wrote.</biography>

      <birthName>Presley, Elvis Aron</birthName>
      <biography>Elvis Presley began his career as first performer of rockabilly, an up-tempo fusion of country music and rhythm and blues with a strong backbeat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing &apos;black&apos; and &apos;white&apos; sounds, made him popular - and controversial - as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. He recorded songs in the rock and roll genre, with tracks like &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog&quot; later embodying the style. Presley had a versatile voice and had unusually wide success encompassing other genres, including gospel, blues, ballads and pop music. To date, he is the only performer to have been inducted into three separate music &apos;Halls of Fame&apos;.  In the 1960s, Presley made the majority of his thirty-three movies - mainly poorly reviewed musicals. His last film, of the 1960s _Change of Habit (1969)_ (qv), deals with several social issues relevant today; romance within the clergy, an autistic child, almost unheard of in 1969, rape and mob violence. It has recently received critical acclaim. 1969 also saw a critically-acclaimed return to live music, followed by performances in Las Vegas and across the United States. Throughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales. He is one of the best-selling and most influential artists in the history of popular music. His death at age 42 on August 16, 1977 shocked his fans worldwide.</biography>
