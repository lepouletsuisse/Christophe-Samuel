      <biography>An Oklahoma native, Justin Hall found his footing in the acting world at the age of thirteen after attending an open call for the film &quot;Bringing Up Bobby&quot;. He was promptly cast in the role of Jamie, as the son of Marcia Cross and Bill Pullman, which he played opposite Milla Jojovich and Spencer List. Justin has since relocated to Los Angeles in full pursuit of his career where he has garnered work in a bevy of short and independent films such as &quot;Two Tickets To Paradise&quot; and the recently shot &quot;The First Hope&quot; among others. When Justin is not working, he spends his time surfing and lending himself to the LA Children&apos;s Hospital where he is a junior ambassador. Justin along with his older sister Katie is also the co founder of the organization &quot;Give Kids Games&quot; which strives to make the stays of children who have been hospitalized more enjoyable. An ardent athlete, Justin has played competitive baseball since the age of five and has won multiple championships with &quot;The Challengers&quot;, his team of seven years. This athletic stamina has proved potent in enabling Justin to give weekly high-energy performances at The Second City where he takes the stage as a member of their only performing teen group. Justin&apos;s comedic chops can also be seen featured in &quot;Mother Nature&quot; and &quot;NBA Lockin&quot; of the popular &quot;Funny or Die&quot; videos produced by Will Ferrell. A talented and dedicated young actor, Justin has just finished working in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s upcoming &quot;Django Unchained&quot; which to date, is being hailed as 2012&apos;s &apos;Movie of the Year&apos;.</biography>

      <birthName>Dern, Bruce MacLeish</birthName>
      <biography>Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies&apos; premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on.  &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under &apos;Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos; (qv). When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well.  Some critics said that &quot;Gatsby&quot; would have been better if Dern rather than &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv) had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson&apos;s brother in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in &quot;Coming Home,&quot; a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous &quot;Oscar curse&quot; that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner &apos;Gig Young&apos; (qv), Dern&apos;s co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don&apos;t They? (1969)_ (qv).  Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even &apos;Anthony Perkins (I)&apos; (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before &quot;Coming Home.&quot; He failed, and his career suffered.  Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3 (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star &apos;Maud Adams&apos; (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern&apos;s star was seriously dimmed.  Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of &apos;Jason Miller (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.  Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, &apos;Diane Ladd&apos; (qv), and their daughter, &apos;Laura Dern&apos; (qv), kicked into high gear.  Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema&apos;s premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv) in _The Cowboys (1972)_ (qv), Dern&apos;s career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor&apos;s artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.</biography>

      <birthName>Vincent, Mark Sinclair</birthName>
      <biography>Vin Diesel was born in New York City. He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theater manager, in an artist&apos;s housing project in New York&apos;s Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin&apos;s fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age 17 and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York&apos;s hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.  Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called &quot;Feature Films at used Car Prices&quot; by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.  Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, _Strays (1997)_ (qv). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) was impressed by _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv) earned Vin more work, when the director of _The Iron Giant (1999)_ (qv) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin&apos;s career has steadily grown, with him securing his first lead role as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film _Pitch Black (2000)_ (qv). That role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <birthDateAsString>1947</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>A veteran of stage, film and television with a variety of characters to his credit, Richard Portnow was named one of the &quot;Actors We Love&quot; from the actors&apos; trade newspaper Back Stage West. It said, &quot;Portnow knows exactly how to hook an audience with every character.&quot; This Brooklyn native has worked steadily for 20 years and has built a solid list of credits, appearing in some of the most highly regarded and successful films and television shows of the past two decades.  His entire family hails from Brooklyn. His folks, Al and Flo, are gone, but he has a brother (Jay), a sister (Gayle), two nephews (John and Sam) and three nieces (Samara, Ilana and Maia). He graduated with a BA degree as a speech and theater major from Brooklyn College. He did not shine while in college, and was discouraged from continuing as an actor with the critique that he was &quot;hopeless and without any ability or talent&quot; (he continues to wonder if the faculty was right). He has been a bartender, an antique dealer, a boxer, an international drug trafficker, a fifth-grade teacher in the NYC public school system, a competitive body builder, a truck driver, a bouncer, a bagel maker, a short-order cook, a marathon runner, a designer, a competitive gymnast, a background extra, a disco dancer at the famed &quot;Arthur&quot; discotheque, and a confused and aimless layabout. Richard is 6&apos;0&quot;, weighs in at a trim 180 lb. and continues to box. He has excellent defensive skills and his ability to stop punches with his face has made him a local favorite.  Portnow assayed the role of attorney Hal &quot;Mel&quot; Melvoin on the Emmy-winning HBO series _&quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999)_ (qv), the lawyer for Uncle Junior, whom he singlehandedly tried to keep out of prison and managed to get himself placed under house arrest instead. His rates for defending Corrado Soprano (Uncle Juniors&apos;s full name) are astronomical, but as Uncle June has said, &quot;Mel, you&apos;re worth every penny&quot;. He has held this role since the show&apos;s inception in 1999.  Richard began his professional career at the famed Cafe La Mama in New York City, appearing in plays by &apos;Tom Eyen&apos; (qv), &apos;Leonard Melfi&apos; (qv), &apos;Jeff Weiss (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Megan Terry (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Tom O&apos;Horgan&apos; (qv) and &apos;Lanford Wilson&apos; (qv). He won &quot;The Best Newcomer of the Year&quot; award from Show Business Magazine as a result of his early work off-off-Broadway. He continued his stage career with starring roles on Broadway in &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; and &quot;A Month of Sundays&quot;. He was in the original cast of &quot;Moonchildren&quot; at the prestigious Royal Court Theatre in London. He has also worked extensively at some of the most highly regarded regional theaters in the country, including The Long Wharf Theater, The Berkshire Theatre Festival for the brilliant director Josephine Abady, The Philadelphia Drama Guild, The Lowell Regional Theater and the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park. &apos;Neil Simon (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Oscar and Felix&quot; at The Geffen Playhouse marked Richard&apos;s Los Angeles stage debut. His has also appeared in &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Writer&apos;s Block&quot;, which was directed by Allen at The Atlantic Theater Company in New York.  Richard has been fortunate and privileged to work with some of the best directors in film today.

      <biography>Jonathan Pryce was born on June 1, 1947, in Holywell, Wales. His father, named Isaac Price, was a coal miner, who died in 1976. His mother, named Margaret Ellen (nee Williams), was a retail cashier. He left the home of his parents at age 16 to attend an art school, where he became interested in drama. At some point he changed the spelling of his last name from Price to Pryce. He studied acting on a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After graduation from RADA, he joined the Liverpool Everyman Theatre and eventually became its Artistic Director.  In the 1970s Pryce established himself on the London stage with appearances in &apos;The Taming of the Shrew&apos;, &apos;Hamlet&apos;, and &apos;Measure for Measure&apos; among other plays. He won the 1977 Tony Award for his Broadway debut in &apos;Comedians&apos;, for which he also earned the 1977 Theatre World Award and the 1977 nomination for Drama Desk Outstanding Actor Award. Pryce earned his second Tony Award 15 years later for the role as &quot;The Engineer&quot;, a half-Vietnamese/half French pimp in &apos;Miss Saigon&apos;. Pryce created the role in the original London production and agreed to reprise the role on Broadway in a transplant of the same production. Despite controversy over his appearance -- the actors union decried the long-standing practice of hiring white actors to play Asian or Eurasian characters, especially given the paucity of roles for Asian characters, and it also objected to the producer&apos;s refusal to even audition any Asian actors -- he gave a brilliant performance.  In 1976 Pryce made his big screen debut in _Voyage of the Damned (1976)_ (qv). But it wasn&apos;t until 1983 that he made a strong impression with his scary performance as a freaky manipulative Mr. Dark in Ray Bradbury&apos;s _Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983)_ (qv). Pryce shot to fame with _Brazil (1985)_ (qv) and his role as Sam Lowry, a technocrat trying to correct an error caused by a bug and himself becomes entangled in psychopathic bureaucracy eventually becoming an enemy of the state. He also filled such strong and authoritative roles, as president Juan Peron opposite Madonna in _Evita (1996)_ (qv), then co-starred opposite Pierce Brosnan as Elliot Carver, the evil megalomaniac media mogul in the 18th Bond film, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv).  Pryce&apos;s versatility and multifaceted talent rarely had a chance to take him beyond playing freaks and villains in film, an imposed forte which he, however, managed to overcome in his numerous stage performances and in a few film and TV works. He went on playing a range of characters marked with sophistication and depth, such as his subtle and nuanced portrayal of author Lytton Strachey in _Carrington (1995)_ (qv), for which he won the Best Actor Award at Cannes. Pryce also shone in musicals &apos;My Fair Lady&apos; and &apos;Oliver&apos; to name just a few. Pryce made numerous works for television ranging from costume dramas to comedy, and from narrations to singing. In January 2006, he replaced John Lithgow as Lawrence Jameson in the acclaimed musical version of &apos;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&apos;. He appeared as the timid Jamaican Governor Wetherby Swann in _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)_ (qv), and the sequel _Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&apos;s Chest (2006)_ (qv), and the third installment of the Pirates franchise, _Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&apos;s End (2007)_ (qv).  Jonathan Pryce has been with his partner, actress Kate Fahy, since 1974 when they met at the Everyman Theatre Liverpool Company, though they have never married. They have two sons, Patrick (born 1983) and Gabriel (born 1986), and one daughter, Phoebe (born 1990). Pryce and Fahy also co-starred in the 2004 production of &apos;The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?&apos;. Fahy and Pryce reside with their family in England.</biography>

      <biography>Giancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.  He was born August 1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For ten years young Giannini lived and studied in Naples, earning his degree in electronics. At the age of 18 he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art D&apos;Amico in Rome, making his stage acting debut there. His credits included performances in contemporary Italian plays, as well, as in Italian productions of &apos;William Shakespeare (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s plays &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer&apos;s Night Dream&quot;. In 1965 he made his debut on television starring as David Copperfield in the TV mini-series made by RAI, the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen debut in _Libido (1965)_ (qv), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has been in a successful collaboration with the legendary Italian director &apos;Lina Wertmüller&apos; (qv), who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears as peasant Tonino who prepares to assassinate dictator &apos;Benito Mussolini&apos; (qv) in _Film d&apos;amore e d&apos;anarchia, ovvero &apos;stamattina alle 10 in via dei Fiori nella nota casa di tolleranza...&apos; (1973)_ (qv), as a sailor in the irony-laden comedy _Travolti da un insolito destino nell&apos;azzurro mare d&apos;agosto (1974)_ (qv) and as a survivor of a concentration camp in the Oscar-nominated _Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975)_ (qv). He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in &apos;Rainer Werner Fassbinder&apos; (qv)&apos;s masterpiece _Lili Marleen (1981)_ (qv).  Giannini also made a reputation for dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv), &apos;Michael Douglas (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Dustin Hoffman&apos; (qv), &apos;Gérard Depardieu&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ian McKellen&apos; (qv), among others. He received a compliment from &apos;Stanley Kubrick&apos; for his dubbing of Nicholson in _The Shining (1980)_ (qv). Giannini&apos;s fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as _A Walk in the Clouds (1995)_ (qv), _Hannibal (2001)_ (qv), _Darkness (2002)_ (qv) and _Man on Fire (2004)_ (qv), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), and reprises the role in the sequel, _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv).</biography>

Occasionally Joel would help out on the family farm but he knew that was not where his future would lead. He always dreamed of being an actor but never thought of it seriously until college. While attending classes at Murray State University he decided that after graduation he would move to Los Angeles. So in the classic story he loaded up his jalopy car and left in the darkness of early morning. Two days later he arrived in Hollywood in July of 2001. After only seven months he landed a part in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) alongside Leonardo Dicaprio, Tom Hanks and was directed by Steven Spielberg.</biography>

In 1983-1985 he studied acting and joined the Armenian Theatre Company Artavadzt of the AGBU under the leadership of director Gerald Papazian. In 1984, he joined the workshop at renown Theatre du Soleil on tour in Los Angeles during the Olympics Art Festival. Abkarian took a month-long acting workshop from Mnouchkine&apos;s mask-maker, Georges Bigot, then was auditioned by Ariane Mnouchkine who invited him to join the company. In 1985 Abkarian returned to Paris, France. There he resumed a successful stage acting career, and had an eight-year-long collaboration with Ariane Mnouchkine, the legendary director of Théâtre du Soleil. There he played leading roles in Greek tragedies and became known for his charismatic performances. He also directed several stage plays in Paris, including Shakespeare&apos;s &apos;Love&apos;s Labour Lost&apos; at the Bouffles du Nord, and Aeschylus&apos;s &apos;The Last Song of Troy&apos; at Bobigny, among others. In 2001 Abkarian won the highest award in French theatre for an actor - the Prix Molière, for his performance in &apos;Une Bête Sur La Lune&apos; (aka.. Beast on the Moon). Since 1993, Abkarian and his actress-director wife, Catherine Schaub, started their own theatre T.E.R.A. (Theatre Espace Recherche Acteur) in Paris. There he has been playing and directing classical and contemporary plays. In the season of 2005-2006, he was brought by The Actors&apos; Gang to direct Shakespeare&apos;s &apos;Love&apos;s Labor&apos;s Lost&apos; in Los Angeles.  Abkarian made his film debut in 1989, in a short film &apos;Ce qui me meut&apos; by director Cédric Klapisch. During his early film career, Abkarian enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with Cédric Klapisch in 6 French films, becoming noticed in the award winning _Chacun cherche son chat (1996)_ (qv). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of painter Archil Gorky in &apos;Atom Egoyan&apos; (qv)&apos;s award winning epic _Ararat (2002)_ (qv). Simon Abkarian won awards for his performance as Eliahou in &apos;To Take a Wife (2004) by director Ronit Elkabetz. That same year Abkarian gave a stellar performance in his first leading role in English, co-starring as He, a passionate Lebanese doctor turned cook who is in love with an American woman (Joan Allen) in _Yes (2004/I)_ (qv) directed by Sally Potter. He made a step forward in his film career with the supporting role as Alex Dimitros in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), playing in several powerful scenes opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv).

      <biography>Lidia was born in a small town called Backa Palanka located in the northern Vojvodina province of Serbia which you probably couldn&apos;t find on map, so don&apos;t worry about it. Her parents moved to Chicago, IL and planted roots when she was a year old. She graduated from DePaul University in Chicago, IL with a Master&apos;s degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. Shortly after college, she got a really bad case of &quot;Artistic itch&quot; caused by a rash of unrealized potential and dreams. To remedy her affliction she left her job in the corporate world to pursue acting in Chicago. After a couple of successful years working and studying the craft in Chicago, she packed her Mitsubishi Eclipse and drove to Los Angeles to continue scratching. She has been working in various theater, TV, film, and commercial projects since. Things have cleared up nicely if you were wondering, thanks. Lidia has been credited under the names Lidia Sabljic, Lidia Mills, and most recently changed her stage name to Lidia Ryan because she felt like it. Lidia spends her free time with her husband, step son, 2 cats, 2 rabbits and a tortoise.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>16 April 1954</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Barkin, Ellen Rona</birthName>
      <biography>Offbeat, unconventionally pretty, and utterly mesmerizing, Ellen Barkin was born in 1954 of Jewish parentage, the daughter of a chemical salesman and hospital administrator. Raised in the South Bronx and Queens, New York area, she wanted to be an actress as early as her teens and was eventually accepted into Manhattan&apos;s High School of the Performing Arts.  Barkin then attended Hunter College and received her degree after double majoring in history and drama. At one point she wanted to teach ancient history, but instead turned her thoughts back to her first love - acting. Barkin then continued her education at New York&apos;s Actor&apos;s Studio. Fearful of the auditioning process, she studied acting for seven years before finally landing her first audition. While continuing her studies, she worked as a waitress at the avant-garde Ocean Club. Performing off-Broadway in such plays &quot;Shout Across the River&quot; (1979), &quot;Extremities&quot; (1983), &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1984) and &quot;Eden Court&quot; (1985), she was applauded across the board for her first film lead in _Diner (1982)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Mickey Rourke&apos; (qv) and &apos;Daniel Stern (I)&apos; (qv), and pursued sexy tough-cookie status thereafter with such quirky roles in _The Big Easy (1986)_ (qv) starring &apos;Dennis Quaid&apos; (qv) and _Siesta (1987)_ (qv) with Irish actor &apos;Gabriel Byrne&apos; (qv), whom she married in 1987 and separated from in 1993 after producing a son and daughter. She and Byrne divorced in 1999.  With trademark squinting eyes and slightly off-kilter facial features, Barkin continued the fascination of her seamy/steamy girl-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks status most notably opposite &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv) in the thriller _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv). In addition, she was well cast as &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv)&apos;s abused wife in _This Boy&apos;s Life (1993)_ (qv), and portrayed &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; in _Wild Bill (1995)_ (qv) with earnest. Other impressionable offbeat projects included roles in _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)_ (qv), _Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)_ (qv) and _Mercy (2000)_ (qv). On TV, she was well-cast in the mini-movie _Clinton and Nadine (1988) (TV)_ (qv) and won an Emmy award for her gripping performance in _Before Women Had Wings (1997) (TV)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Oprah Winfrey&apos; (qv) as another abused wife who, in this case, turns her violent anger on her own daughters.  In 2000, Barkin married billionaire &apos;Ronald O. Perelman&apos; (qv), eleven years her senior and chairman of the Revlon company, and put her career relatively on hold, appearing sporadically in edgy films like _She Hate Me (2004)_ (qv) and _Palindromes (2004)_ (qv). Barkin and Perelman went through an acrimonious divorce in 2006.  Just prior to her divorce in late 2005, Barkin ventured into independent film production with Applehead Pictures, a company she set up with her brother &apos;George Barkin&apos; (qv), who is a scriptwriter and former editor-in-chief of National Lampoon and High Times, and former Independent Film Channel executive &apos;Caroline Kaplan (I)&apos; (qv). In her first major acting appearance since her divorce from Perelman, Barkin co-starred in _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv) with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv), &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv) and former co-star Pacino. She followed up Ocean&apos;s with a supporting role in &apos;Antoine Fuqua&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Brooklyn&apos;s Finest (2009)_ (qv), _Happy Tears (2009)_ (qv) with &apos;Parker Posey&apos; (qv) and &apos;Demi Moore&apos; (qv), and _Twelve (2010)_ (qv).  Recently, Barkin has produced features, including _Letters to Juliet (2010)_ (qv) and _Another Happy Day (2011)_ (qv) (she also starred in the latter project). On the small screen, she appeared in an episode of _&quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009)_ (qv) and her new NBC show, _&quot;The New Normal&quot; (2012)_ (qv), got a sneak peek during the Olympics.  She lives with her two teenage children in Manhattan.</biography>

Got himself noticed playing Steve McQueen&apos;s younger brother in _Junior Bonner (1972)_ (qv), and then scored the lead role of Buford Pusser (!) in the unexpected hit _Walking Tall (1973)_ (qv), an allegedly true tale about a Southern sheriff confronting corruption &amp; gangsters with a large wooden club and a mean attitude. Followed it up by playing a sadistic hit man called Molly, in Don Siegel&apos;s bank heist drama _Charley Varrick (1973)_ (qv). Joe Don Baker&apos;s next few films were rather forgettable until he landed the role of police detective Earl Eischied in _To Kill a Cop (1978) (TV)_ (qv)....which led him into reprising the same character in the short lived TV series _&quot;Eischied&quot; (1979)_ (qv). Since then he has proved he is also quite adept at taking on comedy roles, as well as picking up plenty of work playing lawmen, military men, politicians etc. Keep your eye open for him as a nosy police chief in _Fletch (1985)_ (qv), a meglomanical general in _The Living Daylights (1987)_ (qv), as a redneck father in _Mars Attacks! (1996)_ (qv), and as intelligence operative Jack Wade in the 007 films _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).</biography>

Naturally exuding wisdom and talent, David Calder often appears as just that: wise, scholarly old gentleman in almost any film or television appearance he makes. Undoubtedly an accomplished and easily-recognizable face to British audiences, however David perhaps is better known to American audiences with his appearances in high profile movies such as the James Bond spy-action film The World Is Not Enough (1999) as Sir Robert King, the on-screen father of Sophie Marceau; and then in the Mummy trilogy subtitled Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008).</biography>

      <biography>Born in London in 1980, Chris always wanted to be a part of television and film.  Chris first appeared on television as an 8-year-old on a commercial for Warburton&apos;s Bread, playing a school boy. Chris was then offered a role in Grange Hill in the late 1980s.  He then went back to filming when he was 31 years old, and appeared in over 100 productions in his first year back (during 2011-2012). He was offered roles in huge films such as Skyfall (Daniel Craig as James Bond, bumps into him), Rush (playing a German ambulance man).  It seems that Chris gets a lot of roles playing a businessman, police and CID. Chris is a regular CID officer on ITV&apos;s Midsomer Murders, and has also appeared in soaps such as Hollyoaks and Emmerdale.</biography>

      <biography>Angie Dickinson was born in Kulm, North Dakota, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L. H. Brown. Mr. Brown was the publisher of The Kulm Messenger. The family left North Dakota in 1942 when Angie was 11 years old, moving to Burbank, California. In December 1946, when she was a senior at Bellamarine Jefferson High School in Burbank, she won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights Contest. Two years later, her sister Janet did likewise. Being the daughter of a printer, Angie at first had visions of becoming a writer, but gave this up after winning her first beauty contest. After finishing college, she worked as a secretary in a Burbank airplane parts factory for 3-1/2 years. In 1953, she entered the local Miss America contest one day before the deadline and took second place. In August of the same year, she was one of five winners in a beauty contest sponsored by NBC and appeared in several television variety shows. She got her first bit part in a Warner Brothers film in 1954 and gained fame in the television series _&quot;The Millionaire&quot; (1955)_ (qv) and got her first good film role opposite &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dean Martin (I)&apos; (qv) in _Rio Bravo (1959)_ (qv).

      <biography>An actor on television since the early 1990s, Michael Harney frequently essayed tough men with deeply complicated interior lives in such acclaimed series as &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (ABC 1993-2005), &quot;Deadwood&quot; (HBO 2005-2006) and &quot;Weeds&quot; (Showtime 2005-2012). Harney&apos;s ability to tap into the emotional and spiritual elements of his characters was the result of substantial training and work on the New York theater scene, as well as his early career path as a social worker and prison reform advocate. After years of anonymity on the Off-Broadway circuit, Harney earned his big break as a morally compromised police officer on &quot;Blue,&quot; which led to steady work as a guest performer on countless series. In 2005, he played a hateful townsperson on &quot;Deadwood,&quot; which further increased his profile; he successful transitioned from recurring turns on various series, including an alcoholic detective on &quot;Weeds,&quot; to his first turn as a series regular on &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; (2013).</biography>

      <biography>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation, Jeffrey Wright&apos;s undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business. Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990&apos;s Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright&apos;s harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright&apos;s skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.</biography>

      <birthName>Pacino, Alfredo James</birthName>
      <biography>One of the greatest actors in all of film history, Al Pacino established himself during one of film&apos;s greatest decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies. Born on April 25, 1940, in the Bronx, New York, Pacino&apos;s parents (Salvatore and Rose) divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents&apos; house. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies, one of his favorite activities. Bored and unmotivated in school, the young Al Pacino found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting on the stage, he went through a lengthy period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to make it to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under legendary acting coach &apos;Lee Strasberg&apos; (qv), creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many &apos;70s-era actors. After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, he finally hit it big with &quot;The Indian Wants the Bronx&quot;, winning an Obie award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for &quot;Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?&quot;. His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a junkie in _The Panic in Needle Park (1971)_ (qv) after his film debut in _Me, Natalie (1969)_ (qv). What came next would change his life forever. The role of Michael Corleone in _The Godfather (1972)_ (qv) was one of the most sought-after of the time: &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Warren Beatty (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Ryan O&apos;Neal (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv) and a host of others either wanted it or were mentioned for it, but director &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv) had his heart set on the unknown Italian Pacino for the role, although pretty much everyone else--from the studio to the producers to some of the cast members--didn&apos;t want him. Though Coppola won out through slick persuasion, Pacino was in constant fear of being fired during the hellish shoot. Much to his (and Coppola&apos;s) relief, the film was a monster hit that did wonders for everyone&apos;s career, including Pacino&apos;s, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, however, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama _Serpico (1973)_ (qv) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film _Dog Day Afternoon (1975)_ (qv). He opened eyes around the film world for his brave choice of roles, and he was nominated three consecutive years for the &quot;Best Actor&quot; Academy Award. He faltered slightly with _Bobby Deerfield (1977)_ (qv), but regained his stride with _...And Justice for All. (1979)_ (qv), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. This would, unfortunately, signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced such critical and commercial flops as _Cruising (1980)_ (qv) and _Author! Author! (1982)_ (qv). He took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult hit _Scarface (1983)_ (qv), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. _Revolution (1985)_ (qv) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino became terribly ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script also further derailed a project that seemed doomed from the start anyway. The Revolutionary War film is considered one of the worst films ever, not to mention one of the worst of his career, resulted in his first truly awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino has done much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, _The Local Stigmatic (1990)_ (qv), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking _Sea of Love (1989)_ (qv) as a hard-drinking cop. It marked the second phase of Pacino&apos;s career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice. Returning to the Corleones, he made _The Godfather: Part III (1990)_ (qv) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful _Dick Tracy (1990)_ (qv). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for _Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)_ (qv). He went into romantic mode for _Frankie and Johnny (1991)_ (qv). In 1992 he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in _Scent of a Woman (1992)_ (qv). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic. The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. _Carlito&apos;s Way (1993)_ (qv) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama _Heat (1995)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv) and co-starring &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv), although they only had a few scenes together. He returned to the director&apos;s chair for the highly acclaimed and quirky Shakespeare adaptation _Looking for Richard (1996)_ (qv). _City Hall (1996)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv) and _The Devil&apos;s Advocate (1997)_ (qv) all came out in this period. Reteaming with Mann and then &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv), he gave two commanding performances in _The Insider (1999)_ (qv) and _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). In his personal life, Pacino is one of Hollywood&apos;s most enduring and notorious bachelors, having never been married. He has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a new set of twins with longtime girlfriend &apos;Beverly D&apos;Angelo (I)&apos; (qv). His romantic history includes a long-time romance with &quot;Godfather&quot; co-star &apos;Diane Keaton&apos; (qv). With his intense and gritty performances, Pacino was an original in the acting profession. His Method approach would become the process of many actors throughout time, and his unbeatable number of classic roles has already made him a legend among film buffs and all aspiring actors and directors. His commitment to acting as a profession and his constant screen dominance has established him as one of the movies&apos; true legends.</biography>

      <birthName>Lancaster, Sarah Beth</birthName>
      <biography>Lancaster was born in Overland Park, Kansas, where she grew up with her younger brother, Daniel. Her mother, Barbara, was a homemaker and her father, Michael, was in real estate. It was his job that led the family to Mission Viejo, California when Sarah was ten years old. Soon after the move to Southern California, she began taking acting classes and immediately landed a talent agent. After a few months of commuting from Orange County to Los Angeles for auditions, she secured her first professional series regular role, starring as &quot;Rachel&quot; on _&quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; (1993)_ (qv).  From the time she was in the eighth grade, she was tutored on the set. After she wrapped production on the series, Lancaster, who had been taking college courses at U.C. Irvine to expedite her high school graduation, made the official move to Los Angeles to further pursue her acting career.  She has guest-starred on such hit television series as the top-rated _&quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; (2000)_ (qv) for CBS, HBO&apos;s critically acclaimed _&quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2001)_ (qv), Fox&apos;s _&quot;That &apos;70s Show&quot; (1998)_ (qv) and The WB&apos;s _&quot;7th Heaven&quot; (1996)_ (qv) and _&quot;Dawson&apos;s Creek&quot; (1998)_ (qv).

She garnered attention recently for her recurring role as college student &quot;Madison Kellner&quot; on The WB&apos;s engrossing family drama series, _&quot;Everwood&quot; (2002)_ (qv) for Warner Bros. Television. She played the rock-band-fronting babysitter and love-interest to &apos;Gregory Smith (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s 16-year-old character, &quot;Ephram Brown&quot;.

In addition, Lancaster had a recurring role for FOX on &apos;David E. Kelley (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _&quot;Boston Public&quot; (2000)_ (qv), where she played a snooty high school student running for prom queen.

      <biography>Born in Munich in 1969, Gedeon was raised bilingual (English &amp; German). He was sent to boarding school in England at the age of 8 and transferred to American high school at the age of 12. Gedeon starred in his first movie (Aunt Maria) when he was 10, his second lead role followed one year later in the American / German co-production Blood and Honor (3 part mini series) as Hartmut Keller. By demand of the American and German Producers each scene was shot once in English and once in German, due to his bilingual upbringing, Gedeon was the only actor who did not have to be dubbed in either version.  Gedeon continuously worked in various projects during school vacations until he dropped out of high school after 11th grade. At this time he concentrated on training for 2 years, attending musical school and taking speech and acting classes on the side.  In 1988 Gedeon starred, next to Tony Curtis and Birol Head On by Fathi Akin), in the motion Picture Welcome to Germany which marked the beginning of his career as a grownup. Since then Gedeon has acted in numerous films, including Acting it Out (German film award/ Movie and Bavarian Film award/Actor) by acclaimed German director Wortman, Silence like Glass by Carl Schenkel and Making Up (Student Academy Award USA/German Film Award) by Katja von Garnier. He also starred in the internationally successful television series Detectiv Rex (sold to over 140 territories) and Kobra 11 (Action series, sold to over 120 territories).  in 2006 Gedeon portrayed Henry Neumann, a Jewish boxer trapped in a boxcar with his family on the way to Auschwitz, in the motion picture The last Train. This challenging part, it seems, was the perfect preparation for the biggest opportunity in his career to date, the part of the Jewish Basterd (Will Wicky) in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s new movie Inglorious Basterds.</biography>

      <biography>Elizabeth Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, a small city in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts near the New York border, on February 10, 1974. She describes herself as having been seen as a &quot;goody two-shoes&quot; in her youth who was nominated for the local Harvest Queen.  Banks left home to attend college at the University of Pennsylvania--from which she graduated Magna cum Laude--and went on to attend the Advanced Training Program at the prestigious American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, from which she graduated in 1996. She then moved to New York and worked in the theater, and began getting small roles in films and on television. Seeking more screen work, she moved to Los Angeles and soon began snagging supporting roles. She also had to change her name, to avoid confusion with actress &apos;Elizabeth Mitchell (I)&apos; (qv), and thus changed her last name to Banks.  Her first breakthrough role was as Betty Brant, the secretary of the cantankerous newspaper tycoon in &apos;Sam Raimi&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Spider-Man (2002)_ (qv). She followed up this performance with small roles in other movies: _Swept Away (2002)_ (qv), &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv), _Seabiscuit (2003)_ (qv) and _The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)_ (qv). In 2003 she won the Exciting New Face Award at the Young Hollywood Awards.  Although the winsome, beautiful Banks projected an exceptionally charming screen presence that drew comparisons to &apos;Audrey Hepburn (I)&apos; (qv), she primarily remained in supporting roles. Audiences began to take notice when Banks took the lead in such films as &apos;Kevin Smith (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008)_ (qv) and as &apos;Laura Bush (I)&apos; (qv) in &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s biopic of &apos;George W. Bush&apos; (qv), _W. (2008/I)_ (qv).  In television Banks was a recurring guest star on _&quot;Scrubs&quot; (2001)_ (qv) as Dr. Kim Briggs, the love interest of &apos;Zach Braff&apos; (qv)&apos;s J.D. In 2010 she was cast as &apos;Alec Baldwin&apos; (qv)&apos;s love interest in season four of _&quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006)_ (qv). Originally her character was only scheduled to appear in four episodes, but she was brought back as a recurring character for two more seasons, and earned Emmy nominations for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for two consecutive years.  Now in the spotlight, Banks appeared in back-to-back films, co-starring in _Our Idiot Brother (2011)_ (qv), _Man on a Ledge (2012)_ (qv), _What to Expect When You&apos;re Expecting (2012)_ (qv) and _People Like Us (2012)_ (qv). She also won the highly coveted role as Effie Trinket in _The Hunger Games (2012)_ (qv). She also stars in such films as _Pitch Perfect (2012)_ (qv), _Frank or Francis (????)_ (qv), and _The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)_ (qv).  Banks married &apos;Max Handelman&apos; (qv), a sports writer and producer, in 2003. They welcomed a son, Felix Handleman, who was born via a surrogate in March 2011.</biography>

      <gender>MALE</gender>
      <biography>Gregory Stenson grew up on the mean streets of Las Vegas, Nevada. Today we know him as the 6 foot box-office hero, but his growth spurt didn&apos;t occur to late in his teen years, thus his small size made him a target for bullies. The brutalities he endured as a youngster only made him stronger however and has helped to make him the person he is today. Greg has two loving parents and did the best they could with their lower class status. Gregory hated that his family didn&apos;t have all the things they would like to, things they saw while watching programs like The Jefferson&apos;s and Goodtimes. He wished his family could have such luxuries and live like these TV families did. His major goal in life became to do the best he could to make his families life the best it could possibly be!  His grades in school were never the best, and Gregory couldn&apos;t see himself as a suit anyway, so Gregory looked to other avenues to achieve his goal. It was about this time that his body caught up with and surpassed the size of his classmates, and it wasn&apos;t long before the coach of his High School Football Team noticed Gregory on campus. Greg took to Football like a fish to water and excelled greatly, his skills as a Line Backer helped drive his team to two State Championship wins. By his senior year Greg was a hot commodity and had scouts from colleges all over the country looking him over. Greg took his time deciding on who he should go with and finally decided on Antelope Valley College in beautiful Lancaster, California and the outstanding Marauders Football Team. While an odd choice it was nonetheless the one that Gregory made. His reasoning better to be a big fish in a small pond than a big fish in a much larger pond! His talents as a Line Backer once again proved strong here as they did in High School. He brought many victories to his team the Marauders through his tenure with them and was on the Fast Track to an NFL Career when tragedy struck in one the most prolific games of his college career. During the third down as the Quarter Back was looking for a clear Receiver and a shot to bring the team to victory, Gregory was holding the line with all he had. He had already held off to heavy blitzes on his QB but the last push was too much and he was overrun by two Rushers and was left lying on the ground after the play was through. Gregory didn&apos;t get up and his teammates ran to his side, where they found him screaming in agony.  Gregory was rushed to the local hospital where it was found that his Bicep muscle was entirely ripped from his bone. A terrible injury to have and one that took many months of reconstructive surgery and therapy to correct. Unfortunately this spelled the end of Gregory&apos;s football career as the doctor told him one more injury like this and they don&apos;t know what would happen!  Greg became disillusioned with life and fell into a very dark period in his life, (little is known about this part of his life?) but re-emerged a year later with new determination and with his original goal of a better life for himself and his family at the forefront once more. Gregory had endless nights without sleep trying to figure out how he could make his dream come true, then it hit him like a blitz from a forward in his football days. While thinking about the TV shows he loved so much as a kid, he thought he could play those parts as good if not better than say J.J. did on Goodtimes. So with a new resolve he decided to be an actor.  Just as Gregory had chosen an obscure approach to his Football College Career, he again chose the same method on his way to his Hollywood Movie Actor Career. Gregory didn&apos;t head to Los Angeles or New York as most people do, instead he went to back to Sin City itself, Las Vegas. He knew that more and more movies were being shot there and decided that a big fish in a smaller pond was good enough for him this time as well. He signed with many different agencies as soon as he arrived back in Vegas and not surprisingly was given a very warm reception. His good looks and boyish charm did very well for Gregory indeed. As his agents looked for work for him, sometimes staying up very late to make sure Gregory was looked at seriously for some of the bigger roles, Gregory knew he couldn&apos;t just wait for that &quot;right&quot; acting role to come along so he branched off to &quot;character acting.&quot;  His agents found him work at The Aladdin Casino playing a Genie. Greg enjoyed this work immensely, he loved it when the tourists would smile at him and ask for a photo with him, he thought to himself, &quot;Well if this is what its like to be a big-time movie actor, I think I&apos;m gonna love it.&quot; While playing the Genie he continually went out on auditions, sometimes he would miss some of his work playing Genie, but his producers understood his need to move his career along and gave him time off as needed. While he had not won any parts on the screen or TV yet, he continually tried, knocking down many barriers as he tried. After a year of playing Genie he thought he had explored all the realms of the character so he decided he needed something fresh as it wasn&apos;t fair to him or &quot;Genie&quot; to keep playing a character he saw as &quot;evolved&quot;. So without another job to go to he bid the Aladdin farewell.  But it wasn&apos;t long before Caesar&apos;s Palace heard Gregory was available and immediately made an offer to him to play &quot;Marc Anthony&quot; at their casino. Gregory couldn&apos;t believe his luck, the role of Marc Anthony was one of the most sought-after roles in Vegas. Here he was being offered the role without even an audition! Gregory loved his new role and explored all facets of the character in his day to day workings.  Greg&apos;s movie career also got a shot in the arm at this time as well. One of his agents found him a very small role in the comedy hit &quot;Bubble Boy&quot;. Greg played of all things a security guard in this picture, having never had any experience as a security guard in real life, he learned all he could about his role, going as far as doing temp work as one, before filming started to get an idea of what the character should be about. When the time came to shoot Gregory was more than ready, and brought to the part more that even the writer had hoped to see. Gregory was on his way!  While he continued his Marc Anthony role he went for more and more auditions, picking up a commercial or music video starring role along the way. Gregory&apos;s biggest break came when &quot;Bubble Boy&quot; was released and one of the producers assistants of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv), &apos;Harvey Weintrapper&apos; saw Gregory and his performance. In the script of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) there was a part for a white security officer, and this part was very critical to the unfolding of the whole plot of the movie. Weintrapper called Gregory in and gave him a shot at the part, Gregory with all his zeal again researched the part prior to the meeting. To understand the role he shadowed one of Caesar&apos;s Hotel security men for a day to see what it was all about. When Gregory read the part, Weintrapper was blown away, he had expected a great read from Gregory but this was beyond all expectations. Even though Gregory differed from the original characters concept, they decided to take a chance.  _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) became a stunning hit spectacular and owed this in no small way to Gregory Stenson&apos;s portrayal of The Sentry in his stunning scene that featured him along with two actors each from a Dynasty of acting Royalty. Gregory&apos;s role paired him up against the dynamic Scott Caan (James Caan&apos;s Son) and Casey Affleck (Ben Affleck&apos;s Brother and best buddy as well of Matt Damon). Both Scott and Casey were most impressed with Gregory&apos;s work and invited him to hang out with them after the shoot thus beginning a friendship that lasts to this day. It is a little known secret around insider circles that the three of them are looking at a &quot;western&quot; script to do together.</biography>

Sands also got notice in his very small roles in _Privates on Parade (1983)_ (qv) and _The Killing Fields (1984)_ (qv). It wasn&apos;t until his funny and romantic role opposite &apos;Denholm Elliott&apos; (qv) in _A Room with a View (1985)_ (qv) and then his unusual role in _Gothic (1986)_ (qv) that audiences noticed him and were fascinated with his good looks and unusual but sometimes chilling appearance. He continued work on screen in _Vibes (1988)_ (qv), _Impromptu (1991)_ (qv) and &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Arachnophobia (1990)_ (qv), until his most remembered role as _Warlock (1989)_ (qv), directed by &apos;Steve Miner (I)&apos; (qv). The film was such a major success that he returned for the terrifying sequel, _Warlock: The Armageddon (1993)_ (qv). His other credits include _Naked Lunch (1991)_ (qv), _Tale of a Vampire (1992)_ (qv) and the title role in &apos;Dario Argento&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Phantom of the Opera (1990) (TV)_ (qv). Sands has more recently been in &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _&quot;Rose Red&quot; (2002)_ (qv) and is also occasionally seen on the English stage.</biography>

      <biography>Born into a wealthy and influential English family, Ian Fleming spent his early years attending top British schools such as Eton and Sandhurst military academy. He took to writing while schooling in Kitzbuhel, Austria, and upon failing the entrance requirements for Foreign Service joined the news agency Reuters as a journalist -- winning the respect of his peers for his coverage of a &quot;show trial&quot; in Russia of several Royal Engineers on espionage charges. Fleming briefly worked in the financial sector for the family bank, but just prior to the Second World War, was recruited into British Naval Intelligence where he excelled, shortly achieving the rank of Commander. When the war ended, Fleming retired to Jamaica where he built a house called &quot;Goldeneye,&quot; took up writing full-time and created the character that would make him famous -- British Secret Service agent James Bond, in a novel called &quot;Casino Royale.&quot; Fleming spent the rest of his life writing and traveling the world, but as his Bond character reached new heights of popularity on movie screens, Fleming was in ailing health. He died of a heart attack (his second) in England in August 1964 at the age of 56.</biography>

      <biography>Known throughout the music industry as the &quot;king of jungle&quot;, Goldie is an artist whose ferocious creativity knows no bounds. Born and bred on the breakdancing and hip-hop culture he absorbed during trips to the States in his youth, Goldie was a graffitti artist and an album cover artist before receiving the backing to record his first track, &quot;Terminator&quot;, in 1993. His debut album, &quot;Timeless&quot;, followed two years later, and was hailed by critics as a masterpiece. The album fused the hypersyncopated breakbeats and reggae chic common in jungle music with a provocative bassline and soulful diva vocals. That album&apos;s title track, a 21-minute symphonic piece, was a masterstroke, and the lively &quot;Inner City Life&quot; was a smash. With his reputation firmly established, he released his sophomore album in 1998, Saturnzreturn. The album&apos;s opening track, &quot;Mother&quot; a 60-minute orchestral/drum-n-bass piece, is a haunting track and serves as the companion piece to &quot;Timeless.&quot; The remainder of the album, featuring cameos by &apos;David Bowie&apos; (qv), &apos;Noel Gallagher (II)&apos; (qv) of &apos;Oasis (I)&apos; (qv), and rapper &apos;KRS-One&apos; (qv), is a mishmash of Goldie&apos;s signature sound. Critics were not impressed with this follow-up effort, however; many lambasted the album as too &quot;self-indulgent&quot;. Nonetheless, no one can deny that Goldie is an artist who will continue to amaze his fans and the industry with his epic scope and syncopated vision.</biography>

      <biography>Curtis Rivers was born in Guisborough, North Yorkshire, England in 1970.  He vividly recalls his ambition to become a professional movie stuntman, which began at the age of 8, when he started to send letters to numerous TV stations in order to find out how to achieve this goal.  He was told that he would have to become a professional actor, and highly skilled in no fewer than 6 different disciplines, such as Judo, Fencing, Horse Riding, SCUBA Diving and Parachuting.  Unfazed, he was acting by the age of 12, running half-marathons at 14, SCUBA diving at 15 and skydiving by 16.  On leaving school, Curtis began organising various expeditions and adventures, while adding new skills to his stunt training. Adventures led him as far as the Transylvanian Alps, The Black Sea and beyond.  In his early twenties, he became a professional actor, stage work including a national tour of the U.K. and Ireland, and TV work including the role of Detective Constable Galley in the popular TV Series &quot;The Chief&quot;.  In 1996, at the age of 25, he finally fulfilled his life-long ambition of joining the elite ranks of The British Stunt Register, skilled to the highest levels in Judo, Jujitsu, Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do, Sport Parachuting, Fencing, Riding, High Diving, SCUBA Diving, Hang-Gliding, Trampolining, and Power Boating.  Within just a few short weeks, Rivers found himself doubling for stars such as Hollywood actor Patrick Bergen (Sleeping With The Enemy with Julia Roberts).  In the years that followed, Curtis worked on numerous movies and television shows, including the Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, which saw him killed by Bond no fewer than 5 times! In the 2002 swashbuckling epic &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, Rivers did all of the fencing, riding and even underwater stunts for the star, Hollywood actor James Caviezal (Mel Gibson&apos;s &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; and &quot;Frequency&quot;).  Rivers has also been a regular stunt performer on popular British TV shows such as Casualty, Holby, The Bill, Emmerdale, Ashes to Ashes, Spooks, Doctor Who, Torchwood, Whitechapel, and Midsomer Murders, whilst working on various overseas TV projects.  By 2000, Rivers began to seek new avenues for his talents, and added promotional and P.R. work to his growing list of skills. He promoted the launch of Extreme Magazine in 2000, by coordinating the cover shoot - which saw him reading the magazine 20 metres beneath the Caribbean Ocean, in shark-infested waters! He also wrote a feature for the magazine.  This led to a number of similar magazine promotions, such as Dubai&apos;s SMART magazine (which saw him reading the magazine whilst hanging from a crane - 200ft above the ground!) and also led to him writing various featured articles, for numerous magazines and newspapers all over the world.  By 2001, his successful marketing and P.R. campaigns led to the funding of his first Guinness World Record.  Never opting for the easy life, Rivers chose a world record that had remained intact for over 45 years, despite numerous attempts to better it. The record he chose to attempt was The Longest Duration Parachute Jump.  This project saw him training in industrial freezers as the air temperature at jump altitude would be 60 degrees below freezing. It also required high altitude chamber training with the SAS, and numerous test jumps on oxygen from high altitude.  On 14 February 2002, Rivers took off from Pozoblanco, Spain, and flew in a hot-air balloon to 25,000ft above the earth. He jumped from the balloon and activated his parachute immediately. With skillful canopy control, he over-flew the Andalucian Mountains and flew into the Guinness Book of Records with a flight time of 45 minutes.  This bettered the long-standing official record by 5 whole minutes.  Enjoying the widespread publicity, his sponsors Damart Thermals agreed to fund his next world record attempt. This time he set his sights firmly on the Highest Bungee Jump.  The official Guinness World Record was 8,500ft. However, an unofficial claim came to the attention of Rivers and his team, a claim of a bungee jump from a balloon flying 10,500ft high!  Curtis therefore set his sights higher still, on a jump from the limits of where a human can breathe without oxygen after taking off from sea level - 15,000ft.  On 5 May 2002, Rivers bungee jumped from a hot-air balloon flying 15,200ft above Puertolano in Spain, and was awarded his second Guinness World Record.  Footage of the jump went global, earning his sponsor over £470,000 worth of publicity in the U.K. alone, and over £1million of worldwide publicity and brand promotion.  Rivers still works in the TV &amp; Film business, now also in demand for his skills as both Stunt Coordinator and 2nd Unit (Action) Director.</biography>

      <biography>Nikki was born Sept 2nd, 1997 in Rochelle, Illinois, a town of what is now about 10,000. Rochelle and surrounding communities have also been home to some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest celebrities (Joan Allen and Cindy Crawford to name a couple) and several movies have been filmed on location there. Nikki found her way into acting when she was just four years old. A photographer that had shot some yearly photos of Nikki liked the results from the shoot and proceeded to show some talent agents in the area. Soon Nikki was lucky enough to acquire representation in Chicago and in LA. Coincidentally at the same time she was cast as Raven, an adorable little vampire in the award-winning short Teenage Bikini Vampire and was also cast in her first feature film The Rockville Slayer. During this time she was also contacted by Mali Finn, one of Hollywood&apos;s top casting directors to audition for the role of Jennifer Connelly&apos;s daughter in Dark Water. Nikki eventually lost the role to actress Ariel Gade but with her path already set and seemingly being led by fate, decided to immerse herself full force into the world of entertainment. Her willingness to work hard, mannerism and dedication has helped her greatly in her achievements. Nikki loves all aspects of the film industry and isn&apos;t afraid to jump in and help out whenever she can.  Nikki also loves to write! With the support of many she was fortunate enough to bring one of her own stories to life. She also stars in, co-directed and produced the project (more details to come soon). Nikki has appeared at award ceremonies and conventions. One of her fondest memories came when she was invited to co-host The Dragon Con Independent Film Awards with long time actor Dean Stockwell. She has also been featured several times in Fangoria, one of America&apos;s top Horror magazines and is a current Member of The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror and The Burbank Tournament of Roses Association. Nikki is also an avid supporter of children&apos;s charities and is also the co-founder of Buggaboo Books, a non-profit organization that puts books into school libraries. Nikki has an extensive list of credits that include print, voice over, music videos,commercials and films. Some of her print work consists of SC Johnson,Scott Foresman, Gap, Tapco, AJ Prindle and RC Toys. She has also done commercials for Chevrolet and several music videos. One of Nikki&apos;s most current and favorite voice over projects is The New Testament Youth Edition Audio Bible starring some of Hollywood&apos;s hottest young Celebes like Corbin Bleu, Anna Sophia Robb, Emily Osment,Sean Astin and Marshall Allman.  Thus far Nikki has worked on well over a dozen feature films. Past projects include POTC-Dead Mans Chest, Dork of the Rings, Crazy love, Broke Sky, The Promotion, Dog Jack and Rob Zombies Halloween. Some current projects are Leading Ladies, Fallen Souls, The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas, the highly anticipated Johnny Violence and Satanic Panic(also produced by Nikki) due out later this year. Nikki also has her own production company and is working on several new project including a pilot made for television. Nikki has been blessed with the opportunity to travel and to work alongside some of the most passionate and dedicated people in the industry such as Gore Verbinski, Nic Cage,Jerry Bruckheimer, Jeff Burr, Matt Damon, Steven Soderbergh , Steve Conrad, Orlando Bloom, Sean William Scott, Reiko Aylesworth, Keira Knightley and many more. She looks forward to meeting many new people and to welcoming with much anticipation all the opportunities that lie ahead.</biography>

      <biography>Sean Bean, England&apos;s most versatile actor, holds a stellar career spanning every medium for approximately 20 years, in theater, radio, television and movies. This soulful, green-eyed blonde&apos;s roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villians, as in &quot;Clarissa,&quot; passionate lovers like Mellors in &quot;Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover,&quot; rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heartwrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in &quot;Troy,&quot; where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.  Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Macbeth,&quot; where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed.  Bean, however, remains himself, a man&apos;s man, and in the glizty world of movies this is a rare thing indeed. Bean currently resides in London where he enjoys raising his beautiful daughters, his beloved football, and the occasional pint. In his home country of England, he was recently voted the second sexiest man in the UK, and seemed to enjoy this notoriety, stating, &quot;I don&apos;t have any problems with women seeing me as their ideal bit of &apos;rough&apos;. Why would I?&quot; Well, good to know, because his legions of fans do not have a problem with it either.</biography>

      <biography>Henry Silva was born on September 15, 1928 in Brooklyn, New York City. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged &apos;Michael V. Gazzo&apos; (qv)&apos;s play &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students &apos;Ben Gazzara (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Shelley Winters&apos; (qv), &apos;Harry Guardino&apos; (qv), &apos;Anthony Franciosa (I)&apos; (qv) and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including _The Bravados (1958)_ (qv), _Green Mansions (1959)_ (qv), _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (1960)_ (qv), _The Manchurian Candidate (1962)_ (qv) and _Johnny Cool (1963)_ (qv).  An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva&apos;s turning-point picture was a spaghetti western, _Un fiume di dollari (1966)_ (qv), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted &apos;Charles Bronson (I)&apos; (qv) to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv) in the film _Contract on Cherry Street (1977) (TV)_ (qv), then signed on as Buck Rogers&apos; evil adversary Kane in _Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) (TV)_ (qv) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe&apos;s production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day &quot;to keep in shape and relieve tension&quot;.</biography>

      <birthName>Morse, David Bowditch</birthName>
      <biography>David Morse, a 6&apos; 4&quot; tall blue-eyed blond who performed on stage for 10 years before breaking into film, became established as a respected supporting, character actor and second lead.  He was born the first of four children to Charles and Jacquelyn Morse on October 11, 1953, in Beverly, Massachusetts. He grew up with three younger sisters. After graduating from high school, Morse studied acting at the &apos;William Esper&apos; (qv) Studio. In 1971, he began his professional acting career appearing in over 30 productions with the Boston Repertory Company from 1971 to 1977. In the late 1970s, Morse continued his stage career with the Circle Repertory Company in New York before moving into television and film. In the late 1990s, he returned to the Off-Broadway stage starring in &apos;Paula Vogel&apos; (qv)&apos;s Pulitzer Prize winning drama, &quot;How I Learned to Drive&quot; (1997), for which he won the Drama Desk Award and the Obie.  Morse made his big screen debut in 1980 co-starring as &quot;Jerry Maxwell&quot;, a cheerful bartender turned basketball player, opposite &apos;John Savage (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Diana Scarwid&apos; (qv) in _Inside Moves (1980)_ (qv), written by &apos;Barry Levinson (I)&apos; (qv) and directed by &apos;Richard Donner&apos; (qv). Although _Inside Moves (1980)_ (qv) was nominated for an Oscar, Morse had to wait a few years until his career took off. His big break came in 1982 when he was cast as Dr. Jack &quot;Boomer&quot; Morrison, a young doctor who struggles as a single parent after the death of his wife, in _&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (1982)_ (qv), a medical drama that ran for six seasons. He co-starred as opposite &apos;Jodie Foster&apos; (qv) and young &apos;Jena Malone&apos; (qv) in the Oscar nominated Sci-Fi drama _Contact (1997)_ (qv). In 1999, he appeared in &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Green Mile (1999)_ (qv), with &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv). A year later, he played a supporting role as a kidnapped husband of &apos;Meg Ryan&apos; (qv) in _Proof of Life (2000)_ (qv). In 2002, Morse became the first English-speaking actor nominated for the Golden Horse Award, the Chinese equivalent of the Oscars, for his superb performance as FBI expert &quot;Kevin Richter&quot; in _Shuang tong (2002)_ (qv). From 2002 to 2004, Morse had a regular gig starring as &quot;Mike Olshansky&quot;, an ex-Philadelphia policeman turned cab driver, in the TV series _&quot;Hack&quot; (2002)_ (qv) which ran three seasons and was filmed in Philadelphia, close to his home. In 2006-2007, he has a recurring role on season 3 of an Emmy award-winning medical drama _&quot;House M.D.&quot; (2004)_ (qv).  David Morse has been married to fellow actress &apos;Susan Wheeler Duff&apos; (qv) since 1982. They have three children, one daughter and twin sons. In 1994, after the the Northridge earthquake destroyed his home in Sherman Oaks, Morse moved from LA to Philadelphia with his family, and is currently residing in his wife&apos;s hometown.</biography>

      <biography>Fatimah Taliah is a film and television actress whose journey began as young local talent in Chicago. Her journey has never been easy but when dreams are obtained when doubt is replaced by determination. Fashion and film were long time fantasies that are now coming true for Fatimah Taliah. The art of entertainment has always been a passion since the age of 4. While pursuing a degree in dance and theater at Columbia College in 2004, a twist of fate turned her focus to modeling. An Elite model introduced Fatimah to a modeling agent which landed her a contract with Elite after being spotted walking in a fashion show a friend put together for his class assignment at Columbia. This came after she tried over 100 open modeling calls for the agency and was turned down every time. Destiny definitely took over for Fatimah at that moment and her resume proves it. She has walked for Jennifer Lopez, Glamorama, and Project Runways Macy&apos;s events. Her commercial catalogs include Ashley Furniture, Crème of Nature, Allstate Insurance, and Walmart; to name a few. She has done local stage plays and began her professional career entertaining as a backup dancer for R&amp;B singer, Syleena Johnson co-star of R&amp;B Divas. Although modeling swept Fatimah off into the world of fashion, she never forgot about her love for acting and found a common link between the two. Fatimah keeps balance in both art forms with preparation and planning. Acting classes, fashion magazines and blogs help her stay current on the trends in both of her crafts. She looks forward to her own line of fashion one day and would love to play the villain in a feature film. It&apos;s all in the creative process that excites her. Every success story has its setbacks. Fatimah is very aware of hers - being a brown black woman with the &quot;right look&quot; for Hollywood. She knows people go with what they know and fear taking chances. Her competition is tough. There are days she sheds tears and wants to give up, but frustration only makes Fatimah determined. So in 2012, Fatimah moved from Chicago to L.A. without looking back and signed to InfiniteSpin Management in 2013.</biography>

      <biography>Mark currently lives in London, England with his wife Patsy and their twin boys. He also has two older daughters from a previous marriage. One of which, Sienna has followed in his footsteps into the industry.  Mark began his professional career in his late 20&apos;s in 1991 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada under the mentorship of Robin Phillips, who was at the time, Director General of the Edmonton Citadel Theatre, who cast him in Peter Shaffer&apos;s, &apos;The Royal Hunt of the Sun&apos;, playing Villac Umu (Chief Priest of the Inca Empire). Mark was also a full time police officer in the Edmonton Police Service. But that didn&apos;t deter his acting aspirations. He went on to perform in several more plays at the Citadel Theatre, before making the decision to leave the police service in early 1996, when he accepted a summer contract with Bard on the Beach, a Shakespeare Festival in Vancouver, British Columbia, performing in &apos;The Merchant of Venice&apos; and &apos;Much Ado About Nothing&apos;. Later that same year his film and television career began, where he was fortunate to work with some very good directors and actors on many interesting projects. In 2003 his adventurous nature took him back to London, England where he has continued his career, and hasn&apos;t looked back.  Mark has led an eclectic life, having also been a police officer in the Metropolitan Police Service in London, England in the early 1980&apos;s. He competed for Great Britain and Canada at bobsledding during the mid to late 1980&apos;s. Prior to this he was a track and field athlete, his main events being the 200m and 400m. But his claim to fame was winning the International Police Olympic decathlon in Austin, Texas in 1982, where he also broke the championship record.  Mark continues to look forward to more and more interesting and exciting film, television and theatre projects.</biography>

With more than 51 Million admissions no other German filmmaker drew more people to the cinemas. He runs his own production company Barefoot Films in Berlin.  Born in Freiburg, Germany on December 19th in 1963, Til Schweiger was raised along with his two brothers in his hometown Giessen, Germany. Schweiger went on to attend University, where he studied German and Medicine. Collecting first acting experiences during this time, he decided to give up University for drama school in 1986. After graduation in 1989 he played at several theaters in Cologne and Bonn.  In front of the screen, Schweiger first appeared as an actor in 1991 in _Manta, Manta (1991)_ (qv).

This absolute artistic freedom became a prosperous model for his following projects. The most famous one was _Keinohrhasen (2007)_ (qv) which was also written, produced and directed by Schweiger and became the most successful film in German Theaters in 2008 with a box office result of USD 58.000.000.

      <biography>Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His father had English, and some German, ancestry, while his mother&apos;s family, originally surnamed &quot;Fraga&quot;, was entirely Portuguese. Tom grew up in what he has called a &quot;fractured&quot; family. He moved around a lot after his parents&apos; divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no abuse, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He had no acting experience in college and, in fact, credits the fact that he couldn&apos;t get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started. He met his second wife, actress &apos;Rita Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) on the set of his television show _&quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (1980)_ (qv) - she appeared in one episode in the second season (1981), _&quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (1980) {All You Need Is Love (#2.7)}_ (qv). They have two children, and Tom has another son and daughter by his first wife, &apos;Samantha Lewes&apos; (qv). In 1996, he made his first step behind the camera, directing and writing as well as starring in the film, _That Thing You Do! (1996)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Julia Fiona Roberts, born in Smyrna, Georgia, never dreamed she would become the most popular actress in America. As a child, due to her love of animals, Julia originally wanted to be a veterinarian, but later studied journalism. When her brother, &apos;Eric Roberts (I)&apos; (qv), achieved some success in Hollywood, Julia decided to try acting. Her first break came in 1988 when she appeared in two youth-oriented movies _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv) and _Satisfaction (1988)_ (qv). The movies introduced her to a new audience who instantly fell in love with this pretty woman. Julia&apos;s biggest success was in the signature movie _Pretty Woman (1990)_ (qv), for which Julia got an Oscar nomination, and also won the People&apos;s Choice award for Favorite Actress. Even though Julia would spend the next few years either starring in serious movies, or playing fantasy roles like Tinkerbell, the movie audiences would always love Julia best in romantic comedies. With _My Best Friend&apos;s Wedding (1997)_ (qv) Julia gave the genre fresh life that had been lacking in Hollywood for some time. Offscreen, after a brief marriage, Julia has been romantically linked with several other actors. Julia has also become involved with UNICEF charities and has made visits to many different countries, including Haiti and India, in order to promote goodwill. Julia is one of the most popular and sought-after talents in Hollywood.</biography>

Her father, Nessim Garmezano, was a tailor, from Sicily, who changed his last name when he arrived in the United States. Gorme began singing straight out of high school, with various big bands. But her big break came after she auditioned for, and joined, &quot;The _&quot;Tonight!&quot; (1953)_ (qv) Show&quot; in 1953. There, for $90 a week, she sang solos and sang duets with the up-and-coming &apos;Steve Lawrence (I)&apos; (qv). The two performed on the show for five years, and married in 1957. After their &quot;Tonight Show&quot; stint, the pair had a short-lived TV show of their own, _&quot;The Steve Lawrence-Eydie Gorme Show&quot; (1958)_ (qv). Then, Lawrence entered the Army leaving Gorme, a new mother, to frequent the night club circuit on her own. Two years later, when Lawrence was discharged, the couple came to a decision to enter show business more professionally. Their career took off, with audiences drawn to their penchant for the classics in favor of rock &apos;n&apos; roll, as well as their spontaneous banter.</biography>

      <biography>CeCe Cline&apos;s career is an extraordinary life story. From her leading performances in at least six Broadway productions to her diverse film and television career, CeCe has always been one to watch. Her fascinating upbringing has contributed to her truly exceptional talent in the entertainment industry.  A gifted ballerina and singer since she could literally walk and talk, CeCe&apos;s focus at an early age appeared to be on her dancing career. Trained in various aspects of dance, including tap, jazz, hip hop, break dancing, ballroom and of course, her true love, ballet, CeCe&apos;s teachers quickly discovered that she was a dance prodigy. Just as expected, within one week of putting on her pointe shoes for the first time, CeCe had mastered pointe ballet and was capable of perfectly executing up to 10 pirouettes.  But CeCe&apos;s amazing talents did not stop with dance. She also studied classical piano and voice. When her dance classes would end, she attended voice and piano lessons. As CeCe&apos;s dance career started to excel, she put her singing career on hold, but not until she became one of the youngest performers ever to solo at Carnegie Hall. To this day, Carnegie Hall continues to invite CeCe to perform at the famous venue because of her spellbinding stage presence, fantastic voice and ability to sell out tickets.  Despite her busy childhood which was filled with performances, rehearsals and contract negotiations, CeCe managed to maintain a fairly normal childhood. She loved playing little league baseball on all boys teams, with her father serving as the team manager (he was a professional baseball player) and her mother working as the team mom. She was a school cheerleader, served on student government and was active internationally with BBYO. She excelled academically, both in her public school and with her private set tutor, and never reached below a 4.0 grade point average throughout her school career. While she learned how to balance her checkbook at the age of seven, CeCe admitted to hating math and science and preferred English and History classes.  As though this was not impressive enough, CeCe became a closet screenwriter at the age of nine. Overwhelmed by a desire to tell her own stories, CeCe had already written two screenplays by the age of 11. She, of course, had always planned to cast herself in all of her movies.  In 2004, CeCe and her friends founded the Cassiopeia Theatre Company, Inc., in Los Angeles. CeCe was desperate to perform on the stage again and was inspired by the talent among her Los Angeles friends. Their plays have opened to sold out performances, rave reviews and the Cassiopeia Theatre Company has successfully found a major fan base in the Southern California area. Under CeCe&apos;s direction as President, Cassiopeia is currently branching out into film and television production as well, and is in the process of shooting the pilot for &quot;Boarders,&quot; the true life stories of CeCe, her friend, television writer/ producer Jeny Quine and Marlene Peroutka. Cassiopeia recently produced the stage version of &quot;Boarders&quot; and was met with such a tremendously positive response from network executives and the industry&apos;s most powerful people that CeCe and her fellow producers decided to green-light the pilot shoot.  In addition to creating &quot;Boarders,&quot; CeCe recently sold two screenplays at an astounding seven figure price and will be producing those films as well. In her very limited free time, CeCe is recording another album with original music written by her and her musician friends, with CeCe accompanying herself on piano with some of the songs.  After a near-fatal car accident a few years ago, CeCe persevered as she always has in the past and had an astoundingly quick but painful recovery. In several magazine, television and newspaper interviews, CeCe has contributed her recovery to the support of her friends and family and her need to constantly rise above obstacles. Many of her accomplishments over the past few years, however have been overshadowed by her high-profile romantic relationships, including a top Calvin Klein model, a member of the South African royal family and several fellow famous actors and musicians. After the high profile relationships fizzled, she fell back in love with her high school sweetheart and first love (now a Medical Doctor) and is engaged to be married to him in late 2008.  An avid philanthropist, CeCe devotes part of her time and income to causes that are close to her heart, including organizations representing animal rights, abused kids (some of whom she has interviewed to portray in one of her many brilliant television or film appearances as an abused child), drug prevention (in memory of her close friend, the late actor Christopher Pettiet) and the Dystonia Foundation, a condition with which her own mother is living.  It appears now that CeCe Cline is unstoppable. Her keen business sense, natural born talent, electric personality, classically beautiful looks, and unquenchable drive to succeed all contribute to her phenomenal success. CeCe has several major roles in feature films and television series coming up in this year alone. She is just one starring role away from being a household name and no doubt that is what she&apos;s destined to become.</biography>

      <biography>Her father was a Prussian count (Count von Lehndorff-Steinort) who was involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler in 1944 and hanged that year, when Vera was three. Her mother was arrested, and Vera and her sisters spent the rest of the war in Gestapo camps. They were reunited with their mother after the war, but the family was destitute, and ostracised by other Germans for their father&apos;s treachery. She ended up studying textile design in Florence, where a fashion designer first asked her to model. She had first travelled to New York in 1961 as plain old Vera, but failed to secure a single booking. After retreating to Milan for a spell, she returned to take Manhattan under her new name....

      <biography>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents: a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known in fact as &quot;the hospital murderer&quot;. In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation of stories of one&apos;s line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.</biography>

      <biography>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, &quot;The Candy Store&quot;, while attending college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one&apos;s back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable &quot;tough guy&quot; performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in &quot;Extremities&quot; on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized &apos;Farrah Fawcett&apos; (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv) and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We&apos;re No Angels (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has &quot;Welcome to Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, &quot;Marat/Sade&quot; and the afore-mentioned &quot;Extremities&quot; to his credit. Russo appeared opposite &apos;Johnny Depp&apos; (qv) in &apos;Roman Polanski&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed mobster &quot;Victor Mura&quot; in TV&apos;s short-lived, _&quot;Falcone&quot; (2000)_ (qv), the following year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as &apos;Frank Sinatra&apos; (qv) in _Stealing Sinatra (2003)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Daniel Edward Harland was born on the 11th January 1985 in Ipswich, Suffolk. He grew up in Durham in the North of England from the age of four and spent the majority of his life there. At school, he longed to be a professional footballer where he was handed a chance to join the Sunderland FC Youth Academy. He turned it down, and pursued a number of different aspirations which led to many dead ends. Without any idea where his life was going, his parents, who were both teachers at the time, decided to push him towards acting. He joined New College in Durham in 2002 and studied Performing Arts for three years. After graduating with top marks, he auditioned for many top drama schools such as RADA, Mountview and Guildford, without success. Daniel then took a year out working before finally being accepted into Bath Spa University, where he again studied Acting in 2007.  During his studies, he performed in stage productions such as A Streetcar Named Desire (2007, Faust (2009) and Beautiful Thing (2010) which toured many theatres around the South-East and London. After graduating in 2010, his Film and TV credits included Atonement (2007), The Runner (2008), The White Room (2009), Piggy (2011) and Dark Shadows (2012). He has also appeared in the new James Bond film, Skyfall (2012) and has a number of film projects lined up in the near future.  He also played the role of lead gangster, Terry in Britain&apos;s Biggest Heists Season Two (2010). He received critical acclaim for playing &apos;Jake&apos; in The Runner, who gets mixed up in the murky world of drugs and violence in the slums of Bristol.  He has also trained with Michael Hargreaves of RADA and Gunduz Kalic, founder of East 15 Acting School. He also continues to do a lot of work with the Actors Studio.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>2 September ????</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>John was born and raised in downtown Toronto to Italian parents who made the long journey to Canada to start a new life. He first caught the acting/filmmaking bug in Grade 8. It was then that Aiko Suzuki (sister of David Suzuki) came to his class and taught a course in super 8 filmmaking. John played his first leading role as a blind boy in a film shot in the then new Spadina subway station.  Nevertheless, it would take some time and a diversion into athletics before John would return to his passion for the arts. After a typical childhood of running the streets of his neighborhood and a few scrapes with the law, John would eventually find his focus in athletics at Central Tech High School. It is there that he would take his running to the track. John would go on to be part of the record breaking 4x100m relay team alongside Olympian Atlee Mahorn. It was his speed that would catch the attention of the football team and in his senior year he would be awarded an Athletic Scholarship to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC.  It was in the Simon Fraser Theater program that John&apos;s passion for acting was ignited. John would waste no time, and after 2 years at the University John made the move to New York to join his older brother Frank to further his studies and commit to acting as a life choice. By day John studied with acclaimed acting teacher Julie Bovasso. At night John would go to what he calls &quot;one of the greatest jobs I have ever talked my way into&quot; - an usher at the renowned Vivian Beaumont Theater in the beautiful Lincoln Center. Nightly, John would seat his audiences and then get lost in the magic of the theater as he quietly perched at the top of the stairs.  John found his way back to Vancouver where he spent a few years doing plays, a variety of TV and film projects and eventually landed his first big Hollywood Feature Film- Alive.  Soon after John was in Los Angeles for the Premiere of Alive, and quickly began landing roles, resulting in a permanent move to L.A. It is there that he found what he likes to call his &quot;artistic oasis&quot;: The Actors Studio. This prestigious institution run by its current co- presidents Al Pacino, Ellen Burstyn and Harvey Keitel would soon accept John as a life time member.  John Cassini is regarded as one of Canada&apos;s most versatile and dynamic actors. This multiple Gemini Nominee (honouring the best in Canadian television) has had the distinction of playing regular series leads on both of Canada&apos;s number one television shows. John stars on the award winning and internationally acclaimed drama Intelligence, and the critically praised half hour comedy Robson Arms. It is John&apos;s ability to go from lovable hapless comedic characters, to salt of the earth dads and detectives, to ruthless organized crime figures that keep this veteran of TV, stage and film in demand.  John not only stars on Canada&apos;s most popular television series&apos;, but on international hit TV shows as well. His small screen credits include recurring roles on CBS&apos;s The Handler, Fox&apos;s Brimstone, and Stephen King&apos;s Kingdom Hospital. John has over 50 Guest Star appearances that include multiple episodes on NYPD Blue, ER, The Practice, and the new Jerry Bruckheimer CBS drama Eleventh Hour. His roles in mini-series&apos; include NBC&apos;s 10.5 and 10.5 the Apocalypse, Traffic, and Final Days of Planet Earth .  John also has an impressive list of big screen credits as well. John co-wrote, produced and starred in the award winning independent film Break A Leg starring Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Sandra Oh, Kevin Corrigan and Eric Roberts. Break A Leg went on to win over 10 Best Feature or Audience Awards at various US festivals including Best Actor for John at The Marco Island Film Festival.  His other feature film credits include: The Game, Seven, Alive, Paycheck,and Get Carter, among others. His independent films include Female Perversions , Vice, Chaos, Motorcycle Gang directed by John Milius and The Whole Shebang.  John&apos;s passion for the stage led to him co-founding the 3rd Street Theatre in Los Angeles, where he would perform in such plays as David Mamet&apos;s Edmond, Sam Shepard&apos;s, Geography of a Horse Dreamer, Harold Pinter&apos;s, One For The Road and the LA Weekly Award winning original production of They Shoot Horses Don&apos;t They?  In 2008 John took his talents to Vancouver&apos;s prestigious six-hundred seat theatre, the Stanley Stage, playing the male lead, &quot;Howie Corbett&quot; in the Pulitzer Prize winning play, Rabbit Hole.  John has dazzled audiences and reviewers alike with his acting range, having one reviewer state, &quot;It&apos;s hard to believe this is the same performer who played the steely-eyed, borderline dangerous nightclub manager in Intelligence. Leslie Nielson and Cassini&apos;s scenes together in Robson Arms are the stuff of great comedy.&quot; (Can West Service - Alex Strachan).  John has received industry acclaim throughout his career, and has been honored with a Leo award for Best Lead Actor on Robson Arms and was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Lead Actor for Intelligence. He also received a Gemini Nomination for his work on the critically acclaimed drama Davinci&apos;s Inquest.  John took on the role as producer as well as a lead actor in the feature film, &quot;Guido Superstar - In 2011 John was also a producer on the independent film &quot;Hit &apos;n Strum&quot;, which had a successful theatrical release in Canada and went on to win awards. He also produced a new film version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. John also stars in &quot;The Resurrection of Tony Gitone&quot; directed by Jerry Ciccoritti which is to be theatrically released in March 2013. In the theatre world, John appeared on stage in the spring of 2012 in the play God Of Carnage at the Manitoba Theatre Centre and the Vancouver Playhouse. In 2012 John became Co-Artistic Director of Railtown Actors Studio and in 2013 he will be joining the cast as recurring characters in SyFy&apos;s hit Continuum and the critically acclaimed drama Blackstone on Showcase / APTN.</biography>

After appearing in dozens of local commercials, Scott landed the part of &quot;State Trooper&quot; on the WB TV series &quot;The Strip&quot;, his first SAG part, and later joked with Carl saying, &quot;If didn&apos;t get that part, I shouldn&apos;t be acting&quot;. He was catching the eyes of prominent Vegas casting directors, most notably, Ray Favaro and Merilee Lear and movie auditions began to come his way. Steven Soderbergh personally thanked Scott for making the Ocean&apos;s Eleven Airport Scene spectacular. As an honorably retired State Trooper, Scott gives law enforcement roles added realism and performs them flawlessly. He is sure, the best is yet to come!</biography>

      <biography>A warm and nurturing actor with quiet strength and a friendly smile, Clyde Tull was born in San Francisco, the son of an FBI agent and a homemaker. He was raised in California, Tennessee and Louisiana, a middle child with an older brother and a younger sister.  He made his acting debut when he was 14 years old, along with his future wife, in a Baton Rouge High School production of Beggar on Horseback.  Upon graduation from LSU with a degree in Finance, he volunteered for military service and enjoyed a successful 30 year career in the US Army. Serving throughout the United States and overseas, he held a variety of command and staff assignments at all levels of the Army, retiring in the grade of Colonel.  While still in the Army, Clyde made his first national television and radio commercials for Total Petroleum, thus beginning his professional acting career.  Moving to Los Angeles in 2000, Clyde was cast in the film S1mOne, playing a Catholic Cardinal opposite Al Pacino. In 2002, he became nationally known as the chatty Texan in a popular Budweiser spot highlighted on the Super Bowl. Directed by Allen Coulter, this spot won a Clio, three AICP awards and an Emmy nomination. Popular and endearing, Clyde&apos;s character was brought back the following year for another Super Bowl spot for Budweiser, this time featuring Tim McGraw.  Clyde continues to play a wide array of characters in movies, television and commercials. He has most recently appeared opposite Eddie Izzard on The Riches and opposite Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel on How I Met Your Mother. A true raconteur, he is prized for roles in which his down to earth personality can bring an upbeat spark to a project.</biography>

      <birthName>Manoux, Jean-Paul Christophe</birthName>
      <biography>J.P. Manoux grew up on the beaches of Santa Barbara, California, the oldest of seven. He was involved in children&apos;s theatre productions and took tap dance lessons before attending the Thacher School in Ojai, California. Curiously, that tiny boarding school would provide no less than 3 doctors for NBC&apos;s long running hospital drama ER (Noah Wyle and Leland Orser, the other two). As college applications approached, Manoux&apos;s drama teacher recommended the undergraduate theatre department at Northwestern University.  Surrounded by Chicago&apos;s vibrant theatre scene, J.P. became passionate about improv and sketch comedy. Upon graduating and moving to Hollywood, he sharpened his own comedy chops at L.A. Theatresports, ACME Comedy Theatre, The Groundlings School, and I.O. West. Legit stage productions garnered critical accolades, culminating in 1999 with L.A. Ovation and Backstage West Garland Awards recognizing his work in the world premiere stage musical Reefer Madness.  Over the next few years, J.P. appeared in dozens of TV sitcoms and national commercials including campaigns for Got Milk? and Fruit of the Loom. He was a regular improviser and sketch player on ABC&apos;s 2001 prime-time variety experiment The Wayne Brady Show and he became a celebrity in the world of children&apos;s television thanks to his dual role as &quot;Mr. Hackett&quot; and &quot;Curtis the Caveman&quot; on the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future. During this period, he also voiced the lead role of &quot;Kuzco&quot; in Disney&apos;s animated series The Emperor&apos;s New School. In 2006, J.P. joined the ensemble of ER, recurring as surgical resident Dustin Crenshaw. It would prove to be a shrewd casting move, widely regarded (in the Manoux household) as the single most significant factor in returning the venerable series to its original acclaim, prestige, and sex appeal.  Opportunities to act and direct in Canada led Manoux to pursue immigration north of the border. The Toronto based productions of DisneyXD&apos;s sci-fi/adventure series Aaron Stone and Teletoon&apos;s hybrid animation comedy series Mud pit saw him working both in front of and behind the camera. Still a U.S. citizen, but now a permanent resident of Canada, Manoux routinely hops the border for film and television work, including his recurring role on Community as &quot;The Deanelganger&quot;. He hopes to continue spending summers in Toronto, acting in the new CTV multi-camera sitcom Spun Out which stars Dave Foley of The Kids in the Hall and Newsradio fame.  J.P. Manoux has appeared in over 30 feature films, 90 different television series, and 90 commercials. He has provided voice and motion capture performance for 8 video games, competed as a contestant or celebrity panelist on 6 gameshows, read 2 original pieces for All Things Condsidered on National Public Radio, co-written 1 play, and anonymously authored 1 biography.</biography>

      <biography>Derek was born in London and from an early age was fascinated with film and TV. He would regularly entertain friends and family with his impersonations of famous actors of the day. He attended a local theatre school later in his teens.  Derek was fortunate enough to meet the stage and screen actor Sir Nigel Hawthorne, who was a close neighbour and friend, and encouraged him to think about working within the acting profession and generously agreed to sponsor his application to join British Actor&apos;s Equity.  Derek worked on the first Star Wars film, &apos;A New Hope&apos; in 1976 - this was in fact his first job within the film business. He was chosen to appear as a Medal Bearer and Massassi Guard at the end of the film.  From this start, Derek has been able to cultivate his career in film, winning parts in many major films made in England, including, Flash Gordon, Krull, The Living Daylights, Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade plus many others. He has also worked on TV productions and was PC Craig Lovell in The Bill from 1987 to 1991. He has rubbed shoulders with many great actors, including Robert Mitchum, Julie Andrews, Jack Nicholson, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Sir Laurence Olivier, John Rhys-Davies and most recently Alec Baldwin. Derek was a close friend of the late Marvin Gaye, whilst the singer was recording his last album for Motown, `In Our Lifetime&apos;, in London.</biography>

      <biography>Barnabas Reti has become well-known in Hungary for his ongoing lead role in Baratok kozt, the country&apos;s number 1 TV-series as Erik, a romantic male-lead and bad-boy of Hungarian daytime-TV. He was born in 1982, in Szeged, Hungary. As a very impressive talent in drawing and painting, everybody thought he was going to be a painter or a graphic artist. Although he used to do illustrations for local newspapers as a teenager, his real passion for acting and movies led him to try drama school after the age of 18. He went to Budapest to learn acting and started to work in several theaters. He was first chosen by Peter Greenaway to play a young fascist soldier in his actual film shot on location in Hungary. Another minor on-screen role followed in Being Julia by Academy Award-winner Hungarian director Istvan Szabo where Barnabas played Bruce Greenwood&apos;s gay lover. After 3 years of intensive stage training in Budapest, he traveled to the United States to attend an acting for film course at the New York Film Academy. Returning back to Europe he started his own theatre company with young artists and made his critically acclaimed debut as a director with Tennessee Williams&apos; The Glass Menagerie where he also did the leading role as Tom, the poet. The show toured in Romania and Hungary with great reviews. Then he was invited to Baratok kozt, the most popular TV-show in Hungary for a 3 year-contract witch made him famous and popular countrywide. As a well-known Tv-star he carried on acting on stage in dramas, comedies and musicals and has been continuously working with his theater group becoming a fresh new point of the underground theatre scene of Budapest. Their production of Stephen King&apos;s Misery with him as the male lead has became such a hit success that it went from a small studio to Karinthy Theatre, one of the most popular stages of Budapest. He has played various characters on stage in plays of different genres from drama to comedy. The title role of Albert Camus&apos; classic &apos;Caligula&apos; was his last Hungarian performance before he moved to London to seek for more international opportunities. Recently he played infamous murderer and novelist Krytian Bala in Sky Vision&apos;s upcoming TV crime-docu series &apos;Killers - Behind the Myth&apos;.</biography>

      <birthName>Blanchett, Catherine Elise</birthName>
      <biography>Cate Blanchett was born on May 14, 1969 in Australia to an American father and an Australian mother. She has an older brother and an younger sister. When she was ten years old, her 40-year old father died of a sudden heart attack. Her mother never remarried, and her grandmother moved in to help her mother. Cate graduated from Australia&apos;s National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992 and, in a little over a year, had won both critical and popular acclaim. On graduating from NIDA, she joined the Sydney Theatre Company&apos;s production of &apos;Caryl Churchill&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Top Girls&quot;, then played Felice Bauer, the bride, in &apos;Tim Daly (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Kafka Dances&quot;, winning the 1993 Newcomer Award from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle for her performance. From there, Blanchett moved to the role of Carol in &apos;David Mamet (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s searing polemic &quot;Oleanna&quot;, also for the Sydney Theatre Company, and won the Rosemont Best Actress Award, her second award that year. She then co-starred in the ABC Television&apos;s prime time drama _&quot;Heartland&quot; (1994)_ (qv), again winning critical acclaim. In 1995, she was nominated for Best Female Performance for her role as Ophelia in the Belvoir Street Theatre Company&apos;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Other theatre credits include Helen in the Sydney Theatre Company&apos;s &quot;Sweet Phoebe&quot;, Miranda in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and Rose in &quot;The Blind Giant is Dancing&quot;, both for the Belvoir Street Theatre Company. In other television roles, Blanchett starred as Bianca in ABC&apos;s _&quot;Bordertown&quot; (1995)_ (qv), as Janie Morris in _&quot;G.P.&quot; (1989)_ (qv) and in ABC&apos;s popular series _Police Rescue (1994)_ (qv). She made her feature film debut in _Paradise Road (1997)_ (qv). She also married writer &apos;Andrew Upton&apos; (qv) in 1997. She had met him a year earlier on a movie set, and they didn&apos;t like each other at first. He thought she was aloof, and she thought he was arrogant, but then they connected over a poker game at a party, and she went home with him that night. Three weeks later he proposed marriage and they quickly married before she went off to England to play her breakthrough role in films: the title character in _Elizabeth (1998)_ (qv) for which she won numerous awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. Cate was also nominated for an Academy Award for the role but lost out to &apos;Gwyneth Paltrow&apos; (qv). 2001 was a particularly busy year, with starring roles in _Bandits (2001)_ (qv), _The Shipping News (2001)_ (qv), _Charlotte Gray (2001)_ (qv) and playing Elf Queen Galadriel in the &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy. She also gave birth to her first child, son Dashiell, in 2001. In 2004, she gave birth to her second son Roman. Also, in 2004, she played actress &apos;Katharine Hepburn&apos; (qv) in Martin Scorsese&apos;s film &quot;Aviator&quot; (2004), for which she received an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress. Two years later, she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for playing a teacher having an affair with an underage student in &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2006). In 2007, she returned to the role that made her a star in &quot;Elizabeth: The Golden Age&quot; (2007). It earned her an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. She was nominated for another Oscar that same year as Best Supporting Actress for playing &apos;Bob Dylan&apos; (qv) in &quot;I&apos;m Not There&quot; (2007). In 2008, she gave birth to her third child, son Ignatius. She and her husband became artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company, choosing to spend more time in Australia raising their children.</biography>

      <biography>Escalante Lundy is an American film and television actor and producer, from New Orleans, LA. His most notable role is as &quot;Big Fred&quot; in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Oscar-Nominated film, Django Unchained. Lundy also appears as a prison guard in HBO&apos;s Emmy-Nominated television series Treme and in a Pampers commercial with Super Bowl Championship Quarterback, New Orleans Saints&apos; Drew Brees.  Escalante Lundy was born in New Orleans, LA the eldest of five brothers, to Merline (nee&apos; Roy), retired real estate agent, of Rayne, LA, and Hughes Banks Lundy, a salesman from Innis, LA. Lundy graduated from St. Augustine High School, later receiving his Bachelor&apos;s degree in Urban Planning from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Lundy received Masters degrees in Urban Planning and Geographic Information Systems from the University of New Orleans.  Escalante&apos;s career began as a stage producer in Sacramento, CA. When an actor failed to show-up, Lundy took the role&apos;, garnered success and later decided to focus on acting as a career path. Admittedly, shy by nature, Lundy used acting as a tool to face his fears of public speaking and improve his diction. He continued to hone his acting skills by taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.  Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy&apos;s family members were victims of Hurricane Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate. As the city began to rebuild, Lundy continued to pursue his new found acting passions including focusing on film roles. He studied with renowned acting coaches Veleka Grey (Young and the Restless), Lance Nichols (Curious Case of Benjamin Button and HBO Television Series, Treme) and became a fixture at the acclaimed Jerry Katz Joint (Ivana Chubback Technique). In 2007, Lundy joined the made his New Orleans theatrical debut as co-lead in the production of the &quot;Papaya Man&quot; with the Anthony Bean Community Theater (ABCT)in New Orleans. After having a challenging first rehearsal Lundy says, &quot;I tried to quit but Mr. Bean wouldn&apos;t let me. He gave me legs until I was able to run&quot;  In 2012, Lundy made his major motion picture debut as &quot;Big Fred&quot; in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s spaghetti western, Django Unchained. Lundy&apos;s role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting. Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.</biography>

      <biography>Blue-eyed Vincent Cassel was born in Paris to a leading French actor father, &apos;Jean-Pierre Cassel&apos; (qv) and a journalist mother. Often labeled as a tough guy because of his roles, eclectic choices and talent have made of him a star of European cinema. First in _La haine (1995)_ (qv), the young actor, actually coming from upper classes, succeeded to express the despair of a social class living in the suburbs of towns. This veracity in his play comes from the fact that he was in fact since years in connection with many hip-hop artists from the rising generation, (his own brother was leader of a legendary french rap group). Then the success of The crimson rivers, where he plays a young French cop alongside &apos;Jean Reno (I)&apos; (qv), made of him &quot;the man to count on.&quot; He never hid his taste for rap music, break dance, Capoeira, Brasil and his endless energy, but Vincent is also a family man, married to &apos;Monica Bellucci&apos; (qv), his Italian co-star from _L&apos;appartement (1996)_ (qv) (aka The Apartment); and recently a father.</biography>

      <birthName>McCullough, Bernard Jeffrey</birthName>
      <biography>Bernard Jeffrey McCollough was born in Chicago in 1957. He grew up in Chicago, in a rougher neighborhood than most others, with a large family living under one roof. This situation provided him with a great insight into his comedy, as his family, and the situations surrounding them would be what dominated his comedy. Mac worked in the Regal Theater, and performed in Chicago parks in his younger days. He became a professional comedian in 1977, at the age of 19. He refused to change his image for television and films, and therefore was not very well known for most of the eighties. In 1992 he made his film debut with a small part with _Mo&apos; Money (1992)_ (qv). This started a plethora of small parts in a string of movies, mostly comedies, including _Who&apos;s the Man? (1993)_ (qv), _House Party 3 (1994)_ (qv) and _The Walking Dead (1995)_ (qv). 1995 proved to be a turning point in his career. He did an HBO Special called _&quot;Midnight Mac&quot; (1995)_ (qv), and took a part as Pastor Clever in the Chris Tucker comedy _Friday (1995)_ (qv). Bernie Mac developed a cult following due to the movie and had many small parts since. In 1996 he starred in the memorable &apos;Spike Lee&apos; (qv) movie _Get on the Bus (1996)_ (qv), and was very funny in _Don&apos;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996)_ (qv). About this time he had a recurring role in the TV series _&quot;Moesha&quot; (1996)_ (qv). Bernie Mac&apos;s star was slowly rising from this point. His next couple of movie parts were more substantial, including _How to Be a Player (1997)_ (qv) and _The Players Club (1998)_ (qv). In 1999 Bernie Mac got his most high profile part up to that point in the film _Life (1999/I)_ (qv) starring &apos;Eddie Murphy (I)&apos; (qv).  The new century started a new era for the brash Chicago comedian. He was a featured comedian in _The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)_ (qv). This performance made him more of a household name, and led to many more major parts. In 2001 he played Martin Lawrence&apos;s uncle in _What&apos;s the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)_ (qv) and later that year, was in the star studded remake of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv). However his biggest success was _&quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; (2001)_ (qv), which debuted in 2001 to instant acclaim. However, soon after the series ended, Mac&apos;s health took a turn for the worse. He developed sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease which causes inflammation in the lungs. On August 9, 2008, after weeks of unsuccessful treatments, Bernie Mac died at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 50.  Bernie Mac was a comedian that refused to change his image for Hollywood and said that his life in Chicago was who he was and there was nothing that could change that. He was a mature comedian who was very intelligent and very engaging in his TV, movie and stand-up appearances.</biography>

      <birthName>Roth, Eli Raphael</birthName>
      <biography>Eli Roth began shooting Super 8 films at the age of eight, after watching Ridley Scott&apos;s _Alien (1979)_ (qv) and vomiting, and deciding he wanted to be a producer/director. With his brothers and friends, ketchup for blood and his father&apos;s power tools, he made over fifty short films before attending film school at N.Y.U., where he won a student Academy Award and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1994. He worked in film and theater production in New York City for many years, doing every job from production assistant to assistant editor to assistant to the director. At the age of 20 Roth was development head for producer Fred Zollo, a position he soon left to write full time. To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films _A Price Above Rubies (1998)_ (qv) and _Illuminata (1998)_ (qv) and often worked as a stand-in, where he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that would eventually become _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) with friend &apos;Randy Pearlstein&apos; (qv), and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for his animation series _&quot;Chowdaheads&quot; (1999)_ (qv). Roth and friend &apos;Noah Belson&apos; (qv) (_Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv)&apos;s Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth produced, directed and designed. The episodes were due to run on W.C.W.&apos;s #1 rated series _&quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; (1995)_ (qv) but the C.E.O. was fired a day before they were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up a stop motion series called _The Rotten Fruit (2003) (V)_ (qv) which he produced, directed and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director &apos;David Lynch (I)&apos; (qv), producing content for the website davidlynch.com. In 2001, Roth filmed _Cabin Fever (2002)_ (qv) on a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his producers raised from friends and family. The film was the subject of a bidding war at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion&apos;s Gate, instantly doubling their investors&apos; money. It went on to not only be the highest grossing film for Lion&apos;s Gate in 2003, but the most profitable horror film released that year, garnering critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers as &apos;Peter Jackson (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) and &apos;Tobe Hooper&apos; (qv) . Roth used the film&apos;s success to launch a slew of projects, including Scavenger Hunt, a teen comedy he will write and direct for Universal Studios, and The Box, a horror thriller he is co-writing with &apos;Richard Kelly (I)&apos; (qv) that Roth will also direct. In May of 2003, Roth joined forces with filmmakers &apos;Boaz Yakin&apos; (qv), &apos;Scott Spiegel (I)&apos; (qv), and Greenestreet Films in New York to form Raw Nerve, LLC, a new production company that will produce 3-5 intense, scary, lower budget horror films annually.</biography>

      <biography>French-American character actress Lilyan Chauvin is one perhaps one of many actors or actresses that you know the face, but do not know the name. Chauvin is a long time veteran of the European stage, and is adept at playing strict, but sometimes loving characters. To horror fans, she might be best known as the sinister Mother Superior in Silent Night Deadly Night (1984), but her career started back in the 1950s when she was plucked from the stage to appear in small minor roles in motion pictures. One notable film was with John Wayne in North to Alaska (1960). Over the past thirty years, Chauvin has found herself as one of the busiest character actresses in Hollywood appearing in over forty films and numerous appearances on television. Her many film credits have included &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;, &quot;Predator 2&quot;, &quot;No Place to Hide&quot;, &quot;Universal Solider&quot; (as Jean-Claude Van Damme&apos;s mother) and most recently co-starred with Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio in Steven Spielberg&apos;s &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;.</biography>

      <biography>SHAOBO QIN (Yen), a member of the internationally acclaimed Peking Acrobats makes his motion picture debut in _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv). Shaobo was rehearsing with the Peking Acrobats when he was spotted and asked to audition for the role of Yen.  Born in Guangxi, China in 1982, Shaobo saw his first acrobat performance at the age of eleven and knew immediately that was the career he wanted to pursue. Ironically, that summer when his family enrolled him in an acrobat school, he ran away after only two days. It took three more tries before he found the courage to stay enrolled and pursue the intense training. While he was still at the camp, Shaobo was seen and scouted by a troop manager for the Peking Acrobats. He eventually came to the United States where he trains in Los Angeles for the company&apos;s international tours.</biography>

      <birthName>Orozco, Alfonso Cuarón</birthName>
      <biography>Alfonso Cuarón Orozco was born on November 28th in Mexico City, Mexico. From an early age, he yearned to be either a film director or an astronaut. However, he did not want to enter the army, so he settled for directing. He didn&apos;t receive his first camera until his twelfth birthday, and then immediately started to film everything he saw, showing it afterwards to everyone. In his teen years, films were his hobby. Sometimes he said to his mother he would go to a friend&apos;s home, when in fact he would go to the cinema. His ambition was to know every theatre in the city. Near his house there were two studios, Studios Churubusco and Studios 212. After finishing school, Cuarón decided to study cinema right away. He tried to study at C.C.C. (Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica) but wasn&apos;t accepted because at that time they weren&apos;t accepting students under twenty-four years old. His mother didn&apos;t support that idea of cinema, so he studied philosophy in the morning and in the afternoon he went to the C.U.E.C. (Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos). During that time he met many people who would later become his collaborators and friends. One of them was &apos;Luis Estrada (I)&apos; (qv). Cuaron also became good friends with &apos;Carlos Marcovich&apos; (qv) and &apos;Emmanuel Lubezki&apos; (qv). Luis Estrada directed a short called &quot;Vengance is Mine&quot;, on which Alfonso and Emmanuel collaborated. The film was in English, a fact which bothered many teachers of the C.U.E.C. such as &apos;Marcela Fernández Violante (I)&apos; (qv). The disagreement caused such arguments that in 1985, Alfonso was expelled from the university.  During his time studying at C.U.E.C. he met &apos;Mariana Elizondo&apos; (qv), and with her he had his first son, &apos;Jonás Cuarón&apos; (qv). After Alfonso was expelled, he thought he could never be a director and so went on to work in a Museum so he could sustain his family. One day, &apos;José Luis García Agraz&apos; (qv) and Fernando CáMara went to the museum and made an offer to Cuarón. They asked him to work as cable person in &quot;_La víspera (1982)_ (qv)&quot;, a job which was to prove to be his salvation. After that he was assistant director in Garcia Agraz&apos;s &quot;_Nocaut (1984)_ (qv)&quot;, as well as numerous other films.  He was also second unit director in &quot;_Gaby: A True Story (1987)_ (qv)&quot;, and co-wrote and directed some episodes in the series &quot;_&quot;A Hora Marcada&quot; (1967)_ (qv)&quot;. One New Year&apos;s Eve, he decided he would not continue to be an assistant director, and with his brother Carlos started writing what would be his first feature film: &quot;_Sólo con tu pareja (1991)_ (qv)&quot; (Love in the time of Hysteria). After the screenplay was written, the problem became how to get financial backing for the movie. I.M.C.I.N.E. (Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia), which supports movies financially, had already decided which projects it would support that year, much to Alfonso&apos;s initial chagrin. However, the director of one of those already-chosen projects was unable to direct it, so his project was canceled, and &quot;Sólo con tu pareja&quot; took its place. Despite this being chosen, there was a lot of tension between Alfonso and the I.M.C.I.N.E. executives. Nevertheless, after the movie was finished, it was a huge success. In Toronto festival the films won many awards, and Alfonso started to be noticed by Hollywood producers. &apos;Sydney Pollack&apos; (qv) was the first one to invite him to shoot in Hollywood. He proposed a feature film to be directed by Alfonso, but the project didn&apos;t work and was canceled. Alfonso moved to Los Angeles without anything concrete, and stayed with some friends, as he had no money. Soon after that, Pollack called him again to direct an episode called &quot;_&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1993) {Murder, Obliquely (#1.5)}_ (qv)&quot; of the series &quot;_&quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1993)_ (qv)&quot;, that was the first job he had in U.S., and also the first time he worked with &apos;Alan Rickman&apos; (qv).  After a while, and no real directing jobs, Alfonso wanted to direct something as he needed money. He finally signed a contract with Warner Brothers to direct the film _Addicted to Love (1995) (V)_ (qv). However, one night, he read the screenplay for another film, _A Little Princess (1995)_ (qv) and fell in love with it. He talked to Warner Brothers and after some meetings he gave up directing &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; in order to do &quot;A Little Princess&quot;. Even thought it wasn&apos;t a great box office success, the film received two nominations for the Oscars, and won many other awards. After &quot;A Little Princess&quot; Alfonso developed a project with &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv) starring. The project was canceled, but Cuarón got an offer from Twentieth Century Fox to direct the modern adaptation of the Charles Dickens&apos; classic _Great Expectations (1998)_ (qv). He initially didn&apos;t want to direct it but the studio insisted, and in the end he accepted it. The experience was very painful and difficult for him mainly because there was never a definitive screenplay.  He then reunited with producer &apos;Jorge Vergara (I)&apos; (qv) and founded both Anhelo Productions and Moonson Productions. Anhelo&apos;s first picture was also Alfonso&apos;s next film, the erotic road movie &quot;_Y tu mamá también (2001)_ (qv)&quot;, which was a huge success. During the promotion of the film in Venice, Alfonso met the cinema critic &apos;Annalisa Bugliani&apos; (qv). They started dating and married that same year. &quot;_Children of Men (2006)_ (qv)&quot; was to be Alfonso&apos;s next film, a futuristic, dystopian story. During the preproduction of the film, Warner Brothers invited Alfonso to direct the third Harry Potter film, &quot;_Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)_ (qv)&quot;, an offer which he accepted after some consideration. The film would prove to be the greatest box office success of his career.  In 2003, he had a daughter named &apos;Tess Bu Cuarón&apos; (qv), and in February 2005 another son, called Olmo Teodoro Cuarón. Alfonso Cuarón signed a three-year first-look deal with Warner Brothers, which allowed his films to be distributed world-wide. As a result of that deal, he developed two new projects, _History of Love, The (2007)_ and _Memory of Running, The (2007)_. He also developed another Mexican film &quot;_México &apos;68 (2007)_&quot;, about the violent students&apos; revolt that happened in Mexico in 1968. He directed one five-minute segment of the anthology film _Paris, je t&apos;aime (2006)_ (qv) with &apos;Nick Nolte&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ludivine Sagnier&apos; (qv). His next project, the futuristic film _Children of Men (2006)_ (qv) with &apos;Clive Owen (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Julianne Moore&apos; (qv) and &apos;Michael Caine (I)&apos; (qv) premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2006 having been nominated for three Academy Awards. After his youngest son was diagnosed with autism and the divorce from Annalisa Bugliani he took a break from directing and settled in London where he plans to work on his next projects.  In 2013, Alfonso directed the space thriller _Gravity (2013)_ (qv), which would go win 7 academy awards.</biography>

      <biography>&apos;Guillermo del Toro&apos; (qv) was born October 9, 1964 in Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. Raised by his Catholic grandmother, del Toro developed an interest in filmmaking in his early teens. Later, he learned about makeup and effects from the legendary &apos;Dick Smith (II)&apos; (qv) (_The Exorcist (1973)_ (qv)) and worked on making his own short films. At the age of 21, del Toro executive produced his first feature, Dona Herlinda and Her Son (1986). Del Toro spent almost 10 years as a makeup supervisor, and formed his own company, Necropia in the early 1980s. He also produced and directed Mexican television programs at this time, and taught film.  del Toro got his first big break when _Cronos (1993)_ (qv) won nine academy awards in Mexico, then went on to win the International Critics Week prize at Cannes. Following this success, del Toro made his first Hollywood film, _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), starring &apos;Mira Sorvino&apos; (qv).  del Toro had some unfortunate experiences working with a demanding Hollywood studio on _Mimic (1997)_ (qv), and returned to Mexico to form his own production company, The Tequila Gang.  Next for del Toro, was _El espinazo del diablo (2001)_ (qv), a Spanish Civil War ghost story. The film was hailed by critics and audiences alike, and del Toro decided to give Hollywood another try. In 2002, he directed the &apos;Wesley Snipes&apos; (qv) vampire sequel, _Blade II (2002)_ (qv).  On a roll, Del Toro followed up _Blade II (2002)_ (qv) with another successful comic-book inspired film, _Hellboy (2004)_ (qv), starring one of Del Toro&apos;s favorite actors, &apos;Ron Perlman&apos; (qv).

      <biography>American actor Casey Affleck has an onscreen career dating back to 1988, but his Academy Award nominated work in _The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)_ (qv) gained him wider acclaim in recent years.  Affleck, the younger brother of &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv), was born Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt on 12 August 1975 in Falmouth, Massachusetts to middle-class parents; his mother was a school district employee and teacher, and father was a drug counselor who also served as a social worker, auto mechanic, custodian and bartender. He was also part of the Theater Company of Boston.  Affleck appeared in various roles on television while finishing high school and attending university, including as young Robert Kennedy in the TV mini-series _&quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot; (1990)_ (qv). After graduating high school, he attended George Washington University and eventually transferred into Columbia University in New York, but he never earned his Bachelor&apos;s degree.  Affleck&apos;s first major film role was in &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv)&apos;s _To Die For (1995)_ (qv), in which he co-starred with his future brother-in-law &apos;Joaquin Phoenix&apos; (qv) and &apos;Nicole Kidman&apos; (qv). He would go on to appear in two films with his brother, _Chasing Amy (1997)_ (qv) and _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), which &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv) co-wrote with &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv). Affleck then chose a variety of roles, most of which were considered to be commercial failures, including _Drowning Mona (2000)_ (qv), a modern version of _Hamlet (2000)_ (qv) and _Soul Survivors (2001)_ (qv). He also co-wrote the screenplay _Gerry (2002)_ (qv) with &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv) and &apos;Matt Damon&apos; (qv), which received a limited release in the United States.  But 2001 brought Affleck a plum role as part of Ocean&apos;s Eleven&apos;s ensemble cast. Affleck&apos;s character, a getaway driver named Virgil Malloy, reappeared in _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv). Affleck also received positive critical notice for his work in _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv), and directed &apos;Joaquin Phoenix&apos; (qv) in the &quot;hoax-umentary&quot; _I&apos;m Still Here (2010/I)_ (qv). He also recently co-starred in the ensemble comedy _Tower Heist (2011)_ (qv).  Affleck has signed on to star in the independent movie _Ain&apos;t Them Bodies Saints (2013)_, described as a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-inspired tale about an escaped convict on the run through Texas, trying to reunite with his wife and daughter. He is married &apos;Summer Phoenix&apos; (qv), to whom he was introduced by her brother Joaquin. The couple has two sons.</biography>

      <biography>Robert Curtis Brown has forged a career playing unique, diverse and interesting characters. This talented, Yale-trained actor has an intriguing, accessible screen presence and a depth of feeling and humor. The complexity that Robert brings to his characters may have its origins in his upbringing in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, his years at Yale College, his education at The Yale School of Drama or his experiences traveling the world for work and pleasure. Regardless, since his first professional role fresh out of Yale, Robert has tapped into the ability to embody the essence of whatever character he portrays. From his early work in New York with &apos;Joseph Papp&apos; (qv), &apos;David Hare (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv), &apos;Martin Sheen&apos; (qv), &apos;Kate Nelligan&apos; (qv), &apos;John Landis (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Eddie Murphy (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dan Aykroyd&apos; (qv), Robert has been singled out for his ability to portray a broad range of characters.  Robert has a sterling reputation as an actor from producers, directors and audiences across the country. In his three most recent feature films, _It&apos;s Complicated (2009)_ (qv), _Halloween II (2009)_ (qv) and _The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009)_ (qv), Robert portrays three very different characters. In &quot;It&apos;s Complicated&quot;, he plays &quot;Peter&quot;, &apos;Meryl Streep&apos; (qv)&apos;s architect and friend who will introduce him to &quot;Adam&quot;, played by &apos;Steve Martin (I)&apos; (qv). This funny romantic comedy includes an all-star cast, including &apos;Alec Baldwin&apos; (qv) and &apos;John Krasinski&apos; (qv). &quot;Halloween 2&quot;, directed by &apos;Rob Zombie&apos; (qv), is a terrifying horror film in which Robert portrays the heart-wrenching father, of a murdered girl, who confronts &apos;Malcolm McDowell&apos; (qv). Robert shares the screen with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Jeff Bridges (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Kevin Spacey&apos; (qv) in &quot;The Men Who Stare At Goats&quot;, in which he portrays an Army General bent on staying ahead of the Russians!  Robert has over 120 television and film roles to his credit including: &quot;President Kennedy&quot; in _&quot;Big Love&quot; (2006)_ (qv), &quot;Warden Davis Ollenstein&quot; in _&quot;CSI: NY&quot; (2004)_ (qv), &quot;Morgan Ride&quot; in _&quot;Shark&quot; (2006)_ (qv), &quot;Miles Bainbridge&quot; in _&quot;Big Time Rush&quot; (2009)_ (qv), &quot;Dan, The Weatherman&quot; in the Showtime series, _&quot;Look&quot; (2010)_ (qv) and &quot;Vance Evans&quot; (Sharpay and Ryan&apos;s Dad) in the smash hit, &quot;High School Musical&quot; movies for Disney.  Robert&apos;s acting work has extended beyond film and television and counts himself among the lucky actors who continue to work in the theatre. His long association with the South Coast Repertory and the Pasadena Playhouse are sources of great pride and artistic expression.  Robert devotes his spare time to several charitable organizations including the &quot;Pediatric Aids Foundation&quot;, &quot;Helping Hands for the Blind&quot; and his local schools. In his spare time, he plays softball, bike rides and enjoys gardening, scuba diving and traveling.</biography>

      <biography>Robbie Coltrane, one of Britain&apos;s most popular comedians who was head of debating society at school and won prizes for his art, is now a film star who played in two James Bond films and in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise.  He was born Anthony Robert McMillan on March 30, 1950, in Rutherglen, a suburb of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. His father, Ian McMillan, was a general surgeon who also worked for police pathology. His mother, Jean, was a teacher and a pianist. Young Robbie was fond of art, music, films and cars. He was a voracious reader of his dad&apos;s books on medicine and crime. At age 12 he made his acting debut on stage at Glenalmond College, delivering rants from &quot;Henry V&quot;. At that time he was fascinated with &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) and &apos;Orson Welles&apos; (qv).  He attended Glasgow Art School, majoring in drawing, painting and film, then studied art at Edinburgh&apos;s Moray House College of Education for a year. In 1973 he made a documentary titled &quot;Young Mental Health&quot;, which was voted Film Of The Year by the Scottish Education Council. At that time Robbie took the name Coltrane, due to his love of jazz, and began a career of a stand-up comedian at night clubs, at the Edinburgh Festival, as well as an actor with Edinburgh&apos;s renowned Traverse Theatre.  In 1980 Coltrane made his debut on television as &quot;Border Guard&quot; in BBC&apos;s mini-series _&quot;The Lost Tribe&quot; (1980)_ (qv), then made his big screen debut as a limousine driver in _La mort en direct (1980)_ (qv). In 1981 he appeared in his first leading role as Detective Fritz Langley in _Subway Riders (1981)_ (qv), by famed underground director &apos;Amos Poe&apos; (qv).  He became a well-known face through appearances in The Comic Strip series, then in _&quot;Alfresco&quot; (1983)_ (qv) and Comic Strip movies _The Supergrass (1985)_ (qv) and _The Pope Must Die (1991)_ (qv), among other films. At that time Coltrane had a drinking problem, downing as much as a bottle of whiskey a day. In 1986 he flew to a clinic in Mexico and was treated for obesity. In 1987 his partner for 15 years, Robin Paine, left him for good, leaving her portrait in Coltrane&apos;s barn.  In 1988 Coltrane met then 18-year-old Rhona Gemmell in a pub. They married and had a son, Spencer, and a daughter, Alice. His career took off during the early 1990s with the leading role as Dr. Eddie &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, a forensic psychologist, in the popular TV series _&quot;Cracker&quot; (1993)_ (qv).  He made such a good performance as Valentin Zukovsky, a KGB man turned St. Petersburg mafia lord, in _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) the producers called him back for the same character in _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv). Then Coltrane hit another lucrative franchise; he was personally selected by &apos;J.K. Rowling&apos; (qv) as her choice to play half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in the &apos;Harry Potter&apos; films.  In early 1990s Coltrane wrote an autobiography, &quot;Coltrane in a Cadillac&quot;, and also starred in the eponymous TV series, _&quot;Coltrane in a Cadillac&quot; (1993)_ (qv), in which he indulges his passion for vintage cars and tells with great humor about his 4000-mile journey across America from Los Angeles to New York. In 2003 he separated from his wife. His interests outside of his acting profession has been reading books, and rebuilding and collecting vintage cars. Robbie Coltrane resides in a converted farmhouse in Stirlingshire, Scotland, UK.</biography>

      <biography>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series _&quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv), paired Johnson with the equally cool &apos;Philip Michael Thomas&apos; (qv) as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of &apos;Edward James Olmos&apos; (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named &quot;St. Vitus&apos; Dance&quot; with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world&apos;s favorite cop. For his work on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985.  Johnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled; the names of his first two wives have never been made public. &apos;Tippi Hedren&apos; (qv), Johnson&apos;s co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her daughter &apos;Melanie Griffith&apos; (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s he lived with actress &apos;Patti D&apos;Arbanville&apos; (qv) and they had one son together. He remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for &apos;Antonio Banderas&apos; (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have three children together.  Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the &apos;William Faulkner (I)&apos; (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with &apos;Susan Sarandon&apos; (qv). After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like &apos;John Frankenheimer&apos; (qv), &apos;Sidney Lumet&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dennis Hopper&apos; (qv).  After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _&quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred &apos;Cheech Marin&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jodi Lyn O&apos;Keefe&apos; (qv). Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD&apos;s Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama _&quot;Just Legal&quot; (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by &apos;Jerry Bruckheimer&apos; (qv), and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange flate ballær II (2008)_ (qv) and the Italian films _Bastardi (2008)_ (qv) and _Torno a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in Rome (2010)_ (qv) with &apos;Anjelica Huston&apos; (qv) and &apos;Danny DeVito&apos; (qv), as well as the indie comedy _A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011)_ (qv). &apos;Don Johnson (I)&apos; starred in the 2007 feature film, _&quot;Moondance Alexander&quot; (2007)_, along with &apos;Lori Loughlin&apos; (qv), &apos;Kay Panabaker&apos; (qv), &apos;James Best (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Sasha Cohen (I)&apos; (qv), and &apos;Whitney Sloan&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Jones, Catherine</birthName>
      <biography>Catherine Zeta-Jones was born on September 25, 1969 in Swansea, West Glamorgan, Wales, UK, the daughter of Dai Jones, who formerly owned a candy factory, and Pat Jones. Her brother David Jones (b. 1967) is a development executive and brother Lyndon Jones (b. 1972) works at her production company. Catherine showed an interest early on in entertainment. She starred on stage in &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;. At age 15, she had the lead in the British revival of &quot;42nd Street&quot;. She was originally cast as the second understudy for the lead role in the musical but when the star and first understudy became sick the night the play&apos;s producer was in the audience, she was given the lead for the rest of the musical&apos;s production. She first made a name for herself in the early 1990s when she starred in the Yorkshire Television comedy/drama series _&quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991)_ (qv). The series was a smash hit and made her one of the United Kingdom&apos;s most popular television actresses. She subsequently played supporting roles in several films including _Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992)_ (qv), the miniseries _Catherine the Great (1996) (TV)_ (qv) and a larger part as the seductive Sala in _The Phantom (1996)_ (qv) before landing her breakthrough role playing the fiery Elena opposite &apos;Anthony Hopkins (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Antonio Banderas&apos; (qv) in _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv). She starred in many big-budget blockbusters like _Entrapment (1999)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv), for which many believed she was robbed of an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. In November 2000, she married actor &apos;Michael Douglas (I)&apos; (qv). She gave birth to their son Dylan Michael in August 2000 followed by daughter, Carys, in April 2003. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen&apos;s Birthday Honours List for her accomplishments in film and television.</biography>

      <biography>Christoph Waltz was born to Elisabeth Urbancic, a costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a stage builder. He has 3 siblings. He was born into a theater family. His grandmother was the Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers.  Christoph attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London.  During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however, attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner.  It was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar, Academy Award winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d&apos;interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award.  Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His partner is the costume builder Judith Holste.</biography>

Most notably working with photographer &apos;Mario Testino&apos; (qv) for VMan magazine.  Matt began his acting career with the desire to move, inspire and entertain others through his work. He studied acting rigorously, including four years of training with renowned acting teacher &apos;Aaron Speiser&apos; (qv), coach for &apos;Will Smith (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gerard Butler&apos; (qv), ultimately working in his esteemed Master Class.  In 2012, he launched his own production company, Silver Hero Entertainment, and is producing and developing several projects. His first was a live-action trailer _Captain Planet (2012)_ (qv) in which he played Captain Planet and Captain Pollution. The trailer went viral, being featured and reviewed on over 100 websites, Entertainment Weekly stated &quot;Given the choice between a studio remake and this quasi-gritty indie take, I&apos;d go with the latter.&quot; Sony Pictures took notice of the trailer and is developing a _Captain Planet (????)_ (qv) feature length film.  Kohler wrote, directed, produced and starred in an award-winning short film titled _Typecast (2014/I)_ (qv). He plays Blake, an actor that strives to break free of his &quot;type&quot; to play more interesting roles that move and inspire others. _Typecast (2014/I)_ (qv) is a short film (approx. 26 min) that won &quot;Best of Drama&quot; at the 2014 Wildwood Film Festival. It also has been selected into the 2014 New York International Independent Film Festival and the 2014 Toronto International Film Awards. Although it takes place in the entertainment industry, many will relate to the subject matter and overall message of the film. Matt was inspired to write the script after he saw &apos;Vin Diesel&apos; (qv)&apos;s short film _Multi-Facial (1995)_ (qv).  Matt will produce and star in the feature film titled _Stripped (2015)_ (qv). Stripping to settle her late father&apos;s debt, a young woman tries to balance her feelings for the head bouncer of the strip club, who devises a plan to rob the club on its busiest and most profitable night. Matt will play Mike &quot;Sep&quot; Sepowitz, the ex-football star turned head bouncer of the club. _Stripped (2015)_ (qv) is a highly stylized neo-noir crime thriller in the narrative vein of _The Town (2010)_ (qv) and visually similar to _Drive (2011/I)_ (qv).  His production company, Silver Hero Entertainment, has been hired to produce the feature film titled _Social Norm (2015)_ (qv). A coming of age comedy that deals with the current twenty-something dilemma of career and relationships. Matt will also star as Morgan, the successful business owner of a financial firm.  His latest project announced is titled _Gold (2015)_ (qv), a sports drama that centers around freestyle wrestling leading to the 2016 Summer Olympics. The film deals with the recent announcement that both greco-roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling will no longer be competing sports at the Olympic Games after 2016. There has been much controversy with the announcement as wrestling as been included since the Ancient Olympic Games. Kohler wrote the script and also plans on starring in the film. After the death of his younger brother, an aging freestyle wrestler begins an impossible task to bring home gold in his place.</biography>

      <biography>Andrew Scott grew up in Dublin, Ireland with an older and a younger sister, Sarah and Hannah. His father, Jim, worked in the Fas government employment agency, and his mother, Nora, taught art at a secondary school. Andrew attended Gonzaga, a Jesuit school for boys on the south side of Dublin. From the age of 8 he took drama classes for children on Saturdays at the Anne Kavanagh school, and then in his early twenties he helped tutor younger students. He made two commercials for Irish television, for Flahavan&apos;s Porridge and Disney/Fanta.  At 17 Andrew starred in his first professional role in the 1994 Irish drama &quot;Korea.&quot; Later that year, he matriculated into Trinity College in Dublin to begin a degree in drama, but left after six months. He went on to perform at the Abbey Theatre, the national theater of Ireland, in four plays.  In early 2000 Scott moved to London for a supporting role in &quot;Longitude,&quot; a multi-part television movie starring Michael Gambon. Scott played many roles on the stage and received two Olivier awards. In 2006, Scott made his Broadway debut in David Hare&apos;s &quot;The Vertical Hour&quot; starring with Bill Nighy and Julianne Moore. He was nominated for a Drama League award for his role.  Occasional film and television work in Britain, Ireland and America interspersed his stage career. Most notable of these was &quot;Band of Brothers,&quot; &quot;John Adams,&quot; and the television comedy series, &quot;My Life in Film.&quot;  &quot;Sherlock,&quot; a modern-day revamp of the classic stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for BBC Television proved to be a turning point in Scott&apos;s career in 2010 when he gained notice as Moriarty, the fictional detective&apos;s nemesis.  Scott starred in the play, &quot;Birdland&quot; by Simon Stephens, in the spring of 2014, where he played the role of a jaded rock star contemplating the meaning of fame. His film work stepped up considerably with roles in several important movies including 20th Century Fox&apos;s James McAvoy and Daniel Radcliffe starrer, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; released in 2015.</biography>

      <birthName>Tamblyn, Russell Irving</birthName>
      <biography>Russ Tamblyn might as well face it...he will be a Jet &quot;till his last dying day.&quot; Indelibly linked to the &quot;womb to tomb&quot; role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), it&apos;s not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed the teenage troublemaker who became the &apos;50s equivalent of the Mercutio character in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation.  To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age ten by actor &apos;Lloyd Bridges (I)&apos; (qv) for the play &quot;Stone Jungle&quot;, Russ was soon performing on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as &quot;Rusty Tamblyn&quot; then, the tousle-haired scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_ (qv) starring another child actor, &apos;Dean Stockwell&apos; (qv). Having taken up dancing and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first TV appearance on the &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; Eventually handed a starring role in the &quot;B&quot; film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father&apos;s Little Dividend (1951)_ (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_ (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in one of MGM&apos;s best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn&apos;s timing was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with &apos;Lana Turner&apos; (qv), &apos;Arthur Kennedy (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Hope Lange&apos; (qv) and &apos;Diane Varsi&apos; (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers started dwindling.  Tamblyn&apos;s last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with &apos;Julie Harris (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Claire Bloom (I)&apos; (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring &apos;Richard Widmark&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sidney Poitier&apos; (qv). After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_ (qv), _Satan&apos;s Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical &quot;Cabaret,&quot; Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn&apos;t on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990)_ (qv), it was the first time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic duties and the managing of actress/daughter &apos;Amber Tamblyn&apos; (qv)&apos;s career, she of _&quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot; (2003)_ (qv) fame.</biography>

      <biography>James is a rugged, intense character player with leading man good looks. Having first gained recognition in 1979 as &apos;Ajax&apos; (qv), in his second film, _The Warriors (1979)_ (qv). That same year he garnered acclaim on Broadway with &apos;Richard Gere&apos; (qv) in the concentration camp drama &quot;Bent&quot;.  In a career spanning nearly four decades, James has run the gamut of roles and solid career choices. Ranging from the psychopaths, &apos;Dutch Schultz&apos; (qv) in &apos;Francis Copolla&apos;&apos;s _The Cotton Club (1984)_ (qv) and &apos;Albert Ganz&apos; in Walter Hill&apos;s _48 Hrs. (1982)_ (qv) to Samantha&apos;s lover, the billionaire playboy, Richard Wright, in the HBO series _&quot;Sex and the City&quot; (1998)_ (qv).&quot; James has also garnered roles which highlight a more vulnerable side, such as his guitarist who gets a break in the Oscar-winning short, _Session Man (1991) (TV)_ (qv) or his artist who falls in love with a gargoyle come to life in the best segment of the horror anthology, _Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990)_ (qv) and as Mary Louise Parker&apos;s lover in Boys on the Side.  More recently James starred along side Michael C. Hall in the hit Showtime series _&quot;Dexter&quot; (2006)_ (qv) where he played Dexter&apos;s wise, compassionate, adoptive father, Harry Morgan.

      <birthName>Purcell, Robert Douglas</birthName>
      <biography>Robert Douglas Purcell grew up in the small town of Scituate, which is located on the south shore of Massachusetts. He had a talent for art in school, graduated early from Scituate High School&apos;s Class of 1976 and joined the Marines. He has lived in California since 1982, was married in 1985 and divorced in 2003. He has two beautiful daughters.  Purcell has worked steadily in film, television and commercials. Stage credits include performances as &quot;Major Roberts&quot; in Layon Gray&apos;s acclaimed WWII play, Black Angels Over Tuskegee (2009), &quot;Murray&quot; in the New Voices/OC Playwrights Alliance production of Christmas In Pakistan (2007), &quot;Bobby&quot; in the Dillstar West production of The Soprano&apos;s Last Supper, and &quot;Petruchio&quot; in the Newport Beach Repertory production of The Haunting of Will Shakespeare. Although often cast as the authority figure, such as the &quot;Police Officer&quot; in the short film, The Silent (2006), the villainous Army General &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in the award winning short, Cassandra (2006) or the &quot;Slot Machine Pit Boss&quot; opposite Al Pacino in Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007), Purcell lists some of the more off-beat characters he has played as personal favorites. They include the down and out ex-boxer, ex-mafia tough guy &quot;Joe&quot; in the faith-based feature film, Faith Happens (2005) and the gay &quot;Bartender&quot; in the feature film, Hollywood, Je T&apos;aime (2009).  Purcell can be seen as the Angels Pitching Coach, the Umpire and annoying Sports Writer in several television commercials for Howard&apos;s TV &amp; Appliances, featuring Angels manager, Mike Scioscia and 2nd baseman, Howie Kendrick. His voice (as various characters) can be heard in several humorous Howard&apos;s TV &quot;Halo Hotline&quot; radio spots during the L.A. Angels of Anaheim &apos;07-&apos;09 baseball seasons.</biography>

      <biography>Proclaimed by many critics as one of the best young actors of his generation, Ben Whishaw was born in Clifton, Bedfordshire, where he grew up along with his twin brother James. Ben attended Samuel Whitbread Community College where his interest in theatre grew and he became a member of the Bancroft Players Youth Theatre at Hitchin&apos;s Queen Mother Theatre. During his time there he rose to prominence in many productions, most notably If This Is a Man, based on the book of the same name by &apos;Primo Levi&apos; (qv), a survivor of Nazi World War II prisoner of war camp. The play was taken to the Edinburgh Festival in 1995 where it garnered five-star reviews and great critical acclaim with Ben Whishaw getting rave reviews for his portrayal of Levi. Ben then enrolled in, RADA from where he graduated in 2004 and soon landed the role of Hamlet in &apos;Trevor Nunn&apos; (qv)&apos;s 2004 production making him one of the youngest actors to portray Hamlet on-stage. Hamlet opened to rave reviews with many critics hailing Ben as the next &apos;Laurence Olivier&apos; (qv) and applauding his portrayal of Hamlet with leading critics haling the birth of a star. Whishaw&apos;s film and TV credits include _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv) and &apos;Christopher Morris (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; 2005 sitcom _&quot;Nathan Barley&quot; (2005)_ (qv), in which he played a character called Pingu. He was named &quot;Most Promising Newcomer&quot; at the 2001 British Independent Film Awards (for _My Brother Tom (2001)_ (qv)) and, in 2005, nominated as best actor in four award ceremonies for his Hamlet. He also played &apos;Keith Richards (II)&apos; (qv) in the &apos;Stephen Woolley&apos; (qv) biopic _Stoned (2005)_ (qv). Whishaw played in _Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (2006)_ (qv) as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a perfume maker whose craft turns deadly getting raves once again for his stunning portrayal. Whishaw appeared in 2007&apos;s _I&apos;m Not There (9999)_ as one of the &apos;Bob Dylan&apos; (qv) reincarnations and in 2008 in _&quot;Criminal Justice&quot; (2008)_ (qv) a TV series.

      <birthName>Chu-Kheng, Yeoh</birthName>
      <biography>Born as Yang Zi Chong in the mining town of Ipoh in West Malaysia in the lunar year of the Tiger, she spoke English and Malay before Chinese. A ballet dancer since age 4, she moved to London, England to study at the Royal Academy as a teenager. After a brief dance career, she won the Miss Malaysia beauty pageant title in her native country and the Miss Moomba beauty pageant title in Melbourne, Australia in the early 1980s. Her first on camera work was a 1984 commercial with martial arts star &apos;Jackie Chan (I)&apos; (qv). In 1985, she began making action movies with D&amp;B Films of Hong Kong. She was first billed as Michelle Khan, then later, Michelle Yeoh. Never a trained martial artist, she relied on her dance discipline and her on-set trainers to prepare for her martial arts action scenes.  She uses many dance moves in her films. She still does most of her own stunts and has been injured many times. Ironically, she still cannot read Chinese and she has to have Chinese script read to her. In 1988, she married wealthy D&amp;B Films executive &apos;Dickson Poon&apos; (qv) and retired from acting. Even though they divorced in 1992, she is close to Poon&apos;s second wife and a godmother to Poon&apos;s daughter. When she returned to acting, she became very popular to Chinese audiences and she became known to western audiences through her co-starring roles in the James Bond film _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv) and in the phenomenally successful _Wo hu cang long (2000)_ (qv) aka Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&apos; directed by &apos;Ang Lee&apos; (qv). She turned down a role in a sequel to _The Matrix (1999)_ (qv).  She has her own production company, Mythical Films and has trained with the Shen Yang Acrobatic team for her role in _Tian mai zhuan qi (2002)_ (qv), an English language film she is both starring in and producing. She hopes to use her company to discover and nurture new filmmaking talent. She also wants to act in roles that combine both action and deeper spiritual themes.</biography>

      <biography>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival, by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D&apos;Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner &apos;Roger Avary&apos; (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with friends and fellow auteurs &apos;Alexandre Rockwell&apos; (qv), &apos;Robert Rodriguez (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Allison Anders&apos; (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino&apos;s next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv). The film did fairly well theatrically.</biography>

      <biography>Sandra Bullock was born in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., to Helga (Meyer), a German opera singer, and John W. Bullock, a U.S. voice teacher from Alabama. She grew up on the road with her parents and younger sister. She often performed in the children&apos;s chorus of whatever production her mother was in. That singing talent later came in handy for her role as an aspiring country singer in _The Thing Called Love (1993)_ (qv). Her family moved back to the Washington area when she was adolescent. She later enrolled in East Carolina University in North Carolina, where she studied acting. Shortly afterward she moved to New York to pursue a career on the stage. This led to acting in television programs and then feature films. She gave memorable performances in _Demolition Man (1993)_ (qv) and _Wrestling Ernest Hemingway (1993)_ (qv), but did not achieve the stardom that seemed inevitable for her until her work in the smash hit _Speed (1994)_ (qv). She now ranks as one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. For her role in _The Blind Side (2009)_ (qv) she won the Oscar, and her blockbusters _The Proposal (2009/I)_ (qv), _The Heat (2013/I)_ (qv) and _Gravity (2013)_ (qv) made her a bankable star. With $56,000,000, she was listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records as the highest-paid actress in the world.</biography>

      <birthName>Paymer, David Charles</birthName>
      <biography>One of modern TV and moviedom&apos;s most sturdy and reliable character actors, David Paymer dreamed of being an actor from early childhood. Although he came from a traditional middle-class Jewish family that urged him to become a doctor or lawyer, Paymer felt more at home in the world of the thespian. At 14, he used a fake I.D. to see The Graduate, which starred a young Dustin Hoffman. He grew up in Oceanside, New York, where his father was in the scrap metal business. His mother, a homemaker, had fled Belgium with her family to escape the Nazis. When his father quit the scrap metal business to pursue music, it inspired young Paymer to give his acting dream a try. His aborted big break came when he was cast in the TV series, St. Elsewhere, as &quot;Dr. Wayne Fiscus&quot; - then promptly dumped and replaced by Howie Mandel. Luckily, his real big break was destined to be on the big screen, as &quot;Ira Shalowitz&quot; in the Billy Crystal vehicle, City Slickers. Crystal was so pleased with Paymer&apos;s work that he wrote the part of &quot;Stan Yankelman&quot;, beleaguered brother of the titular character in the movie, Mr. Saturday Night, especially for Paymer. The part earned Paymer an Oscar nomination in 1993.  &quot;That was like getting my passport stamped&quot;, said Paymer and he was quickly in demand by directors such as Spielberg (&quot;Amistad&quot;), Redford (&quot;Quiz Show&quot;), Oliver Stone (&quot;Nixon&quot;), David Mamet (&quot;State &amp; Main&quot;), Steven Soderbergh (&quot;Ocean&apos;s 13&quot;), and Sam Raimi (&quot;Drag me to Hell&quot;). Chameleon-like in his portrayals, Paymer has since starred in hundreds of roles in film &amp; television, notably &quot;The American President&quot;, &quot;Get Shorty&quot;, &quot;Payback&quot;, &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, &quot;In Good Company&quot;, Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s &quot;Twixt&quot; and Kenneth Branagh&apos;s &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow One&quot;.  Paymer received Golden Globe nominations for &quot;Mr. Saturday Night&quot; and for HBO&apos;s &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;. Paymer became a hyphenate in 2002, directing the acclaimed comedy short &quot;Candor City Hospital&quot; for Showtime. He has since directed over 60 episodes for broadcast television, including such hits as &quot;Grey&apos;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The Mentalist&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; &amp; &quot;The Unit&quot;. He is also a producer and director on the CW series &quot;Hart of Dixie&quot;. Paymer resides in Santa Monica, CA with his wife and two daughters.</biography>

      <biography>Skipper Landry was born on Veterans Day, 1971 on Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska to Paul &amp; Margarita Landry. Soon after his father&apos;s enlistment was up, his family moved back to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and settled down.  Medical issues kept Skipper from attending most of elementary and middle school, but he eventually was able to attended, and graduate from Calvary Christian School. During his high school years he landed his first job, a cashier at K-mart at the age of 15. In his junior year until well into college, he worked along side of friends such as Jeff, Chris, Zeke and Lyle as a DJ at local night clubs. He attended Louisiana State University for a time where he failed out due to frequenting the student union rather than classes.  Skipper eventually settled down working as a security and fire alarm technician where he worked most of his adult life and still holds an active NICET III Life Safety license.  One constant throughout his life was his need to be creative. Early on it manifested through landscaping lawns in his neighborhood, then through building, modifying, restoring and showcasing cars and motorcycles. At one point in time he bought and restored a 1982 DeLorean DMC12. Most recently his need to be creative has taken the form of acting and cinematography.  At the age of 38, he was introduced to acting by a fluke. Skipper began taking classes in acting in New Orleans and was soon showing up in bit parts in feature films. His has been in featured in major motion pictures, tv series, a few made for tv movies and just recently wrapped on an independent supernatural thriller and is filming his first co-staring SAG role in January 2013.  Moving to acting full time in 2012 has been a major step toward building a creative outlet and entertaining others by telling good stories.</biography>

      <birthName>Boring, Jeremy Davies</birthName>
      <biography>Jeremy Davies attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, California. He made his film debut starring in David O. Russell&apos;s acclaimed first film, the Indy classic, &quot;Spanking the Monkey&quot;, which became a surprise Sundance Film Festival winner, earning Jeremy an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Debut Performance.  Davies&apos; portrayal of Tom Hanks&apos; interpreter, &apos;Private Upham&apos;, in Steven Spielberg&apos;s Academy Award winning film, &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; also earned him considerable critical acclaim and subsequent Oscar buzz.  Davies&apos; other film credits include Steven Soderbergh&apos;s &quot;Solaris&quot;, with George Clooney and Viola Davis; &quot;Going All the Way&quot; with Ben Affleck; &quot;The Locusts&quot; with Vince Vaughn; Wim Wenders&apos; &quot;Million Dollar Hotel&quot;; Lars von Trier&apos;s acclaimed avant-garde films, &quot;Dogville&quot; and &quot;Manderlay&quot; with Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsgard; &quot;Rescue Dawn&quot; with Christian Bale and Steve Zahn, and directed by the legendary Werner Herzog; &quot;Nell&quot; with Jodie Foster and Liam Neeson; &quot;Half Nelson&quot; writer/directors Ryan Fleck &amp; Anna Boden&apos;s &quot;It&apos;s Kind of a Funny Story&quot;; &quot;Guncrazy&quot; with Drew Barrymore, and Jan de Bont&apos;s &quot;Twister&quot; with Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  In television, Davies was invited to join the cast of JJ Abram&apos;s groundbreaking show, &quot;Lost&quot;, and soon after, his character, &apos;Daniel Faraday&apos;, quickly became an integral part of the &quot;Lost&quot; mythology and a favorite of critics and fans (to the extent that ABC began selling Faraday bobbleheads).  After &quot;Lost&quot;, Davies joined Timothy Olyphant, Walton Goggins and Margo Martindale on Graham Yost&apos;s acclaimed, Emmy winning FX show, &quot;Justified&quot;, based on a short story by the great Elmore Leonard. Wildly against his better judgment, Yost generously granted Jeremy unusual freedom to develop the character of Mags Bennett&apos;s middle son, and Davies&apos; subsequent ferocious and fragile Richard the Third-esque portrayal of Harlan, Kentucky outlaw &apos;Dickie Bennett&apos; was so far removed from &apos;Daniel Faraday&apos;, his work earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor.  Davies&apos; television work also includes the Emmy-honored HBO film, &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;.  Davies was raised without television, and experienced a vividly nomadic (non-military brat), low-income childhood, growing up throughout the US and abroad, including Vermont, Seattle, Oregon, Kansas, Michigan, New Orleans, Latin America, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and the Kingdom of California.</biography>

      <biography>British classical stage and TV actor Tim Pigott-Smith is a familiar face both here and in his native England. A drama major, he graduated from the University of Bristol in 1967 (where he frequently lectures) and made his professional debut two years later with the Bristol Old Vic. Predominantly a stage player in both regional and repertory, he made his Broadway debut in &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; as Dr. Watson in 1974. Over the years, he has appeared opposite England&apos;s theatre royalty including Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Geraldine James, Margaret Tyzack, and Patrick Stewart. He formed his own theatre company in later years, Compass, and served as its artistic director from 1989-1992. In addition, he has directed several major productions including &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;A Royal Hunt of the Sun.&quot; He has taken several Shakespearean classics to TV, including his Hotspur in &quot;Henry IV, Part I&quot; and Angelo in &quot;Measure for Measure,&quot; and delivered impressive performances in such prestigious mini-series productions as &quot;Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years,&quot; &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot; and &quot;The Jewel in the Crown.&quot; Lesser known for his body of film work, such movies as Aces High (1976), his film debut, Joseph Andrews (1977), Victory (1981), Clash of the Titans (1981), State of Emergency (1986), Remains of the Day (1993), and Martin Scorcese&apos;s Gangs of New York (2002) have yet given him that necessary breakout role. Tim is a frequent broadcaster who has recorded many audio books and has published the anthology, &quot;Out of India.&quot; He has long been married to actress Pamela Miles and they have one son, Tom, who is a concert solo violinist. He recently scored critical acclaim in &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; (both London and Broadway), and as Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot; Most recently he graced the stage with Ms. Mirren in the 4 1/2 hour production of &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra.&quot;</biography>

There, he plays the role of Cesar Uman, a poor Guatemalan who attempts to break (illegally) to the United States through its border with Mexico</biography>

      <biography>Born at Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot, Ben grew up with his two brothers and one sister. He attended Charters School in Sunningdale from 1999-2004 where he studied Drama and Art as his main subjects. After leaving school he worked as a chef in a private all girls school for three years waiting to be accepted into a college apprenticeship to become an electrician. He then went on and qualified as an electrician and got his degree in Electrotechnical Technology after three years of hard work. But throughout this time he had also built his own production company &quot;Full House Productions&quot; and wrote, produced, directed, acted and edited two short films, many sketches and a Internet series which became very popular and he also got a spot on the front of the Bracknell newspaper for a jump to fame. He has since gone for his dream of becoming an actor in British film, and built his experience from the ground up taking the lead role in Short film Toxicity which entered Cannes Short Corner.</biography>

      <birthName>Fowler, Kevin Spacey</birthName>
      <biography>As enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey has always kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, &quot;the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person&quot;.  There are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Thomas and Kathleen Fowler in South Orange, New Jersey. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. They eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister&apos;s tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played &quot;Captain von Trapp&quot; opposite classmate &apos;Mare Winningham&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Maria&quot; in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (&apos;James Stewart (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Johnny Carson (I)&apos; (qv) were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.  He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, &apos;Val Kilmer&apos; (qv)) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of &quot;Henry VI&quot;.  Festival head &apos;Joseph Papp&apos; (qv) ushered the young actor out into the &quot;real world&quot; of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in &apos;Henrik Ibsen&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Ghosts&quot;. He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in &apos;David Rabe (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot;). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, &apos;Jack Lemmon&apos; (qv), on a production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;Long Day&apos;s Journey Into Night&quot;. While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as &quot;Uncle Louie&quot; in &apos;Neil Simon (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s Broadway hit &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot; and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;.  Spacey&apos;s film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in _Heartburn (1986)_ (qv). Deemed more of a &quot;character actor&quot; than a &quot;leading man&quot;, he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain &quot;Mel Profitt&quot; on the TV series _&quot;Wiseguy&quot; (1987)_ (qv). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in _Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)_ (qv), a sadistic Hollywood exec in _Swimming with Sharks (1994)_ (qv), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in _The Usual Suspects (1995)_ (qv).  The &quot;Suspects&quot; role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in &apos;David Fincher&apos; (qv)&apos;s thriller _Se7en (1995)_ (qv) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in &apos;Al Pacino&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Looking for Richard (1996)_ (qv), Spacey made his own directorial debut with _Albino Alligator (1996)_ (qv), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in _L.A. Confidential (1997)_ (qv) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in _Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997)_ (qv). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban satire _American Beauty (1999)_ (qv) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences&apos; imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.  No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he&apos;s finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.  In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, _Cloaca (2003) (TV)_ (qv)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s A Moon for the Misbegotten along with &apos;Colm Meaney&apos; (qv) and &apos;Eve Best&apos; (qv), and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the &apos;David Mamet (I)&apos; (qv) 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by &apos;Jeff Goldblum&apos; (qv) and &apos;Laura Michelle Kelly&apos; (qv).  In 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, House of Cards. Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show&apos;s first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include outstanding lead actor in a drama series.</biography>

      <biography>Born and raised in Chicago and New York City, James DuMont was destined for television; his great Uncle Alan B. DuMont created the DuMont Television Network of the &apos;40&apos;s and &apos;50&apos;s, which featured Jackie Gleason in &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, filmed on DuMont television cameras and broadcast in homes on DuMont TVs. James began his career in Chicago as a child model as the 1966 Gerber Baby. Modeling led to television commercials for McDonald&apos;s and Sears and professional theatre where he performed in &quot;Peter Pan &amp; Oliver Twist&quot;. At the age of 10, James was paid to DJ at Dingbat&apos;s Disco in Chicago, where the local bouncer was Mr. T and his DJ mentor was none other than the originator of House Music DJ Larry Levan. This eventually led to his DJing at the famed Studio 54 in NYC and then to his performing with the Joffrey Ballet starring Rudolph Nureyev. DuMont got his SAG card by dancing in the street to Ray Charles in &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot; He then booked his first speaking role in the classic 80&apos;s film &quot;Class&quot; with Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy. James attended Whitney Young High School with the future First Lady Michelle Obama and was in the 100th graduating class of Evanston Township High School, known for it&apos;s actor alumni, which includes John &amp; Joan Cusack and Jeremy Piven. In his senior year, James starred in a production of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (which was attended by many Holocaust survivors).  James went to Boston University where he continued to act in Theatre and DJ. In between his sophomore and junior years, James booked the play &quot;American Buffalo&quot; in NYC, and was offered company membership with Ensemble Studio Theatre (EST) working with then up-and-coming playwrights John Patrick Shanley, Richard Greenberg and Craig Lucas. After leaving BU for NYC, James worked steadily in Theatre, discovered Buddhism (which he still practices today) and made his Broadway debut in the highly lauded play &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; (which nudity was required for the part). Working opposite Stockard Channing and Courtney B. Vance. Journalist George Plimpton wrote a piece for Esquire Magazine about James and his experience as &quot;the Nudist Buddhist.&quot; After &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; closed, James performed in &quot;Throwing Your Voice&quot; co-starring Mary Louise-Parker, Brooke Smith, and Sam Robards in EST&apos;s One Act Marathon. This earned James rave reviews. James then decided to &apos;go nude&apos; once more in the National Tour of &quot;Six Degrees.&quot;  When that tour ended, James moved to Los Angeles, where he helped create EST-The LA Project (EST/LA), producing and developing over 200 plays.

      <biography>Shae Wilson had just entered her freshman year in high school the day she watched a Charlie&apos;s Angels&apos; episode and her future was set: she was determined to play the fourth angel. The next morning she tracked down the school drama teacher and gave her no choice but to get her in a drama class. Thus began her career as an actor.  It wasn&apos;t Charlie&apos;s Angels that launched her acting career, it was playing the heroine. She beat out over 10,000 actors who came to Las Vegas to compete for Star Trek The Experience roles. For the next seven years she bravely battled aliens as an officer on the Starship Enterprise. Her ability to save the human race was so impressive, it landed her a lead in the sci-fi feature, War of the Planets.  Shae is much more than an alien fighter. She has continued to grow in diversity through study and challenging roles in TV, film, theater, and commercials. For example in Ocean&apos;s 13, she played the soft spoken ticket agent alongside a star studded cast. Her portrayal of an harassed cocktail waitress on America&apos;s Most Wanted was so moving,, it led to the capture of an at-large criminal. She won the hearts of audiences and critics as Toby in the stage production of Niel Simon&apos;s&quot;The Gingerbread Lady.&quot; Her charisma and naturalness in front of the camera have landed her with many commercials.  Her lifelong passion for creating characters and performing spills over into improv. As an understudy with the world-famous Second City Comedy Troupe, her kooky-and convincing--characters kept audiences rolling in the aisles.  Shae compliments her acting as a talented singer and dancer, which makes her a triple treat. She has wowed audiences around the country as Florence Ballard in an ensemble that impersonates the Supremes and placed first in several hip hop dance contests!  Shae gives back by sharing her gift in nonpaying productions. Most recently she played a woman twice her age in &quot;The Party&quot; at a retirement center. During the meet and greet, residents were shocked to learn that she wasn&apos;t one of them.  Shae expresses equally intense passion and dedication in her biggest roles of all-mother, daughter, sister and friend. She is grateful for the love and support of those around her who constantly reminder that no matter how tough the business gets, &quot;Nobody puts baby in a corner.&quot;</biography>

      <birthName>Bonaventura, Anthony Paul</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Chicago and raised in Northwest Indiana, Tony&apos;s childhood was a far cry from the nurturing and stable environment in which all children should be raised. Taken away by DCFS from his biological parents at age 2 due to substance abuse, Tony and his older brother lived with their biological aunt for a short period before being taken away yet again. Tony and his brother were placed in several different foster homes before finally being adopted by Dr. Angelo and Kathy Bonaventura at the age of 9. But, as normal as Tony thought his life was, he still had his ups and downs. Tony&apos;s parents divorced when he was 13. Growing up, Tony found himself getting into trouble at school and with the law. He was kicked out of several different high schools; once at St. John&apos;s Military Academy for escaping in the trunk of a friends car. Tony also attended Valparaiso High School but was kicked out his senior year. During this tough time, Tony was incarcerated and finally got his GED. On November 4th, 1997 Tony&apos;s father, whom he was very close to, died of cancer. Although Tony&apos;s life was characterized by instability, one thing remained constant; he wanted to act. At age 21, Tony became the father to a beautiful baby girl named Michela. It was at this point he knew he had to focus on achieving his goals, and that meant making changes. Tony left Indiana and moved to Chicago when he was 23 hoping to get started on his acting career. Tony enrolled at Columbia College for two years majoring in Film and also took acting classes at the Audition Studio. He worked on several low budget films including The Guys (2004), which premiered at the Music Box at the Chicago Comedy Film Festival and I Was A Mathlete Until I Met Margo Marris (2003), which premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival, Tribeca, Newport Beach, Dances with Films (Santa Monica, CA), and the Sidewalk Moving Film Festival. When Tony wasn&apos;t working on films he did some theater work at Navy Pier, one of Chicago&apos;s biggest tourist attractions. In This Town, Tony plays the role of Jimmy, a young man who has a one night stand with his adolescence alongside his childhood friends.</biography>

      <biography>Teri Lynn Hatcher was born in Palo Alto, California, USA, as the only child of Owen and Esther Hatcher, and grew up in nearby Sunnyvale, California. Her father is a nuclear physicist and her mother is a computer programmer. She spent her childhood dancing and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team that had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large headdresses they wore. She was voted &quot;Most Likely to Become a _&quot;Solid Gold&quot; (1980)_ (qv) Dancer&quot; by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers.  Hatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series _&quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977)_ (qv). She went on to play &quot;Penny Parker,&quot; a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress on _&quot;MacGyver&quot; (1985)_ (qv). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy &quot;Lois Lane&quot; on _&quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993)_ (qv), saying that she didn&apos;t want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as &quot;Penny Parker.&quot;  She married actor &apos;Jon Tenney&apos; (qv) in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter &apos;Emerson Tenney&apos; (qv) on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play &quot;Sally Bowles&quot; in a road tour of Cabaret. The tour debuted in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly comedic soap opera _&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004)_ (qv), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega-hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, &quot;Susan Mayer,&quot; was consistently named as America&apos;s favorite &quot;Desperate Housewife.&quot; Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG Award for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show&apos;s first season was even over.</biography>

      <biography>Gregory Allen Gabroy grew up in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania and during his formative years attended the prestigious Haverford School. It became apparent early on that Gregory had a gift for public performance, winning several public speaking awards and being featured on stage as an actor as well as singer. During his tenure, he also appeared in several independent films including Ice Scream, The Ten Commitments and the critically acclaimed Ace of Hearts. After graduating with honors, he went on to attend Tulane University. During his time in New Orleans he received instruction from Ashley Nolan and while abroad in Spain went under the tutelage of R. Domenech. Upon his return to America, he was asked to model for a alcohol awareness campaign and offered his voice talent as a public service announcer to WTUL 91.5 FM. Graduating cum laude with a double major in History and Spanish, he left New Orleans just a few months before Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. His return to the Philadelphia area after graduating college allowed him to hone his acting skills by taking several classes with Mike Lemon and participating in several more independent films. After taking stock and with his family&apos;s blessing, Gregory packed two suitcases and bought a one way ticket to Los Angeles. He has never looked back.</biography>

      <biography>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular radio disc jockey on Chicago&apos;s number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment instead.  While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970&apos;s based major motion picture, &quot;American Gangster.&quot; Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time, Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70&apos;s style afro and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson&apos;s eyes and the hairstyle befitting of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, &quot;Common Sense.&quot;  With the successful major motion picture, &quot;American Gangster&quot; under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was &quot;Django Unchained,&quot; and the role was that of the character named, &quot;Blueberry,&quot; a slave turned killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861. &quot;Django Unchained&quot; went on the be Mr. Tarantino&apos;s highest grossing film to date.

      <birthName>Craig, Daniel Wroughton</birthName>
      <biography>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre&apos;s most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as &quot;James Bond&quot; in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv).  He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of &quot;Ring O&apos; Bells&quot; pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.  At the age of 14, Craig played roles in &quot;Oliver&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre&apos;s (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as &quot;Agamemnon&quot; in Shakespeare&apos;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director &apos;Edward Wilson (I)&apos; (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside &apos;Ewan McGregor&apos; (qv) and &apos;Alistair McGowan&apos; (qv), then later &apos;Damian Lewis (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Joseph Fiennes&apos; (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of &apos;Colin McCormack (I)&apos; (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named &apos;Ella Craig&apos; (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray &quot;James Bond&quot;, in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with &apos;Eric Bana&apos; (qv) under the directorship of &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv).  Craig&apos;s reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool &quot;007&quot;. He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv), &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Timothy Dalton&apos; (qv) and &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as &quot;Bond&quot;.</biography>

      <biography>Raised in the South of France, the only child Philippe Durand started his career with the Alphabet Theater, a reputable independent theater company in Nice, in the play entitled &quot;Dieu aboie-t-il?&quot; by Francois Boyer. Encouraged by the reviews, Philippe pursued acting, mostly stage, playing the leading men in &quot;The School Of Wives&quot;, &quot;Don Juan&quot; and &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; among others. Philippe&apos;s father was a wonderful singer and his mother was a ballerina at a very young age. After the war, Philippe&apos;s parents decided to live a different professional life. Nevertheless when Philippe was born, the artistic vibes were already there. Philippe got his first theatrical roles with the studio Of the Victorine: &quot;Ombres&quot;, &quot;Heidi&quot;, an appearance in &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; with Michael Caine and Steve Martin, and &quot;Monte-Carlo&quot; with Joan Collins. But it was on stage, at the National Theater of Nice directed at the time by Jacques Weber, that Philippe caught the attention of the producers and agents with the lead role of the tormented and versatile soldier in love, Woyzeck, in &quot;Woyzeck&quot; by Georg Buchner. Philippe won a critic Award for the role (1994). Philippe is also a singer-songwriter and at a very young age played piano at the well-known Conservatory of Nice He won many prizes from age 5 to 18 before starting an acting career a few years later. Philippe began competing in sports at an earlty age as well and is an accomplished athlete. He won competitions in skiing, swimming, tennis, and soccer. Since said competitions Philippe has continued to practice sports on a regular basis.  It was in Paris that Philippe started to write and to direct while pursuing his acting career. With four shorts (two award-winning in European festivals), three full scripts and his credits as an actor under his belt, Philippe arrived in Los Angeles. He bought an old American car at first and was working hard to smoothe his accent. Being stuck in LA traffic was helpful for Philippe. He practiced constantly that way. He soon appeared in a series of guest-starring roles in &quot;USA High&quot; (1998), &quot;Seven Stages&quot;, the co-lead in the independent film &quot;Pinter&quot;, and the lead in another independent film &quot;The Islander&quot;. He then booked a guest-starring role in the Emmy Award-winning show, &quot;Frasier&quot; (2001), played the role of a mean French lover in the feature film &quot;Not Entirely Awake&quot; (2002), booked the co-lead in the French-English-Italian feature &quot;Two Lonely Friends&quot; (2003), and a challenging co-starring role in &quot;American Dreams&quot; (2004), playing the French Mercenaire, Rene, who gives JJ (played by Will Estes) a hard time. He also played on stage the role of Valmont in &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; by Laclos. Philippe has been seen in a feature film with Christopher Walken entitled &quot;Balls of Fury&quot;(Focus Pictures/Universal)(2007). He went to Brazil to play the role of the race car pilot Symington in &quot;Bluecross&quot;. He played on stage Jean-Pierre, the French lover of an American girl named Emma, in a love triangle story entitled &quot;The Innocent Love of a Butterfly&quot;. This play was originally a screenplay that will be soon made into a feature film. He passed successfully his first audition at the Actors Studio with a scene from Fool For Love by Sam Sheppard, playing the role of Eddie, a cowboy. For a Frenchman, that was already an accomplishment. Something that will help him later on. Meanwhile Philippe has been pursuing his writing and directing career in the US and in Europe. Philippe&apos;s first American movie as a writer-director, &quot;Black and Blue&quot;(2005-2006), was a touching story about missing children. &quot;Black and Blue&quot; received acclaims from associations for the missing children. In 2008 he was approached to be part of an epic story about love and racism with an American cast. Philippe&apos;s other focus has been a compelling love story drama entitled &quot;The Innocent Love of a Butterfly&quot;. Philippe will be involved in this feature film as an actor, writer, among an international and Award winning cast. Presently the main project that brings Philippe to the US is a spectacular feature film drama entitled &quot;The Devil Never Sleeps&quot;, by director Ralph Server, winner of the 2004 New York Independent Film Festival with the film &quot;Without Mercy&quot;. Philippe has been approached by writer-director Ralph Server to play the lead role in this unique drama, in the style of &quot;Ocean 11&quot;, and was seduced by the depth and complexity of his character. This role went to Alain Delon 15 years ago before the sudden death of one of the producers, Boris Sagal, that stopped the production of the film at that time. An international cast with American names and a number of outstanding upcoming and known young actresses will be part of &quot;The Devil Never Sleeps&quot;. Philippe&apos;s fascination for westerns took an unexpected turn when a director from New York asked Philippe to play a co leading role in a western. Enthusiastic, Philippe accepted the role and even trained to look and act like a real cowboy. His previous experience as a cowboy in the play Fool for Love was helpful. On a personal level, Philippe has been engaged three times. His last love story sadly ended at the end of the year 2009 after 3 years. Although Philippe likes to say that being engaged to a girl with all the qualities a man desires and who is not in the same business was such a relief. But life goes on. Philippe has recently been dating a beautiful and talented young woman. Is she or not involved in the acting world? A love story to be continued...</biography>

      <biography>Undoubtedly one of the most influential film personalities in the history of film, Steven Spielberg is perhaps Hollywood&apos;s best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. Spielberg has countless big-grossing, critically acclaimed credits to his name, as producer, director and writer. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1946. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western _&quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1957)_ (qv). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed _Escape to Nowhere (1961)_ (qv), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister &apos;Anne Spielberg&apos; (qv), and _The Last Gun (1959)_ (qv), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed _Firelight (1964)_ (qv), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed _Slipstream (1967)_ (qv), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed _Amblin&apos; (1968)_ (qv), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin&apos; also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, _Duel (1971) (TV)_ (qv), with &apos;Dennis Weaver (I)&apos; (qv). In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as &apos;Rod Serling&apos; (qv)&apos;s _&quot;Night Gallery&quot; (1969)_ (qv), _&quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (1969)_ (qv) and _&quot;Columbo&quot; (1971) {Murder by the Book (#1.1)}_ (qv). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.  Spielberg&apos;s first major directorial effort was _The Sugarland Express (1974)_ (qv), with &apos;Goldie Hawn&apos; (qv), a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: _Jaws (1975)_ (qv). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic _Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)_ (qv), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable _I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978)_ (qv), and followed that effort with _Used Cars (1980)_ (qv), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, &apos;Kurt Russell (I)&apos; (qv)\\&apos;Jack Warden&apos; (qv) comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with _Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)_ (qv), with &apos;Harrison Ford (I)&apos; (qv) taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was _Poltergeist (1982)_ (qv), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story _E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)_ (qv). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reece&apos;s Pieces in &quot;E.T.&quot; Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like &quot;E.T.&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up &quot;Raiders&quot; with _Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)_ (qv), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as _The Goonies (1985)_ (qv), and was the brains behind the little monsters in _Gremlins (1984)_ (qv). He also produced the cartoon _An American Tail (1986)_ (qv), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster _Back to the Future (1985)_ (qv), which made &apos;Michael J. Fox (I)&apos; (qv) an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book _The Color Purple (1985)_ (qv), with &apos;Whoopi Goldberg&apos; (qv) and &apos;Oprah Winfrey&apos; (qv), with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed _Empire of the Sun (1987)_ (qv), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.  The late 1980s found Spielberg&apos;s projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film _Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)_ (qv). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed _Always (1989)_ (qv) as well as _Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)_ (qv), and _Back to the Future Part II (1989)_ (qv). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama _Dad (1989)_ (qv), with &apos;Jack Lemmon&apos; (qv) and &apos;Ted Danson&apos; (qv), which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, he produced the animated series _&quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; (1990)_ (qv), _&quot;Animaniacs&quot; (1993)_ (qv), _&quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; (1995)_ (qv), _&quot;Freakazoid!&quot; (1995)_ (qv), _&quot;Pinky, Elmyra &amp; the Brain&quot; (1998)_ (qv), _&quot;Family Dog&quot; (1993)_ (qv) and _&quot;Toonsylvania&quot; (1998)_ (qv). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as _The Land Before Time (1988)_ (qv), _We&apos;re Back! A Dinosaur&apos;s Story (1993)_ (qv), _Casper (1995)_ (qv) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of _The Flintstones (1994)_ (qv), where he was credited as &quot;Steven Spielrock&quot;. Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed _Hook (1991)_ (qv) and produced such films as the cute fantasy _Joe Versus the Volcano (1990)_ (qv) and _An American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991)_ (qv). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller _Arachnophobia (1990)_ (qv), _Back to the Future Part III (1990)_ (qv) and _Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)_ (qv). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed _Schindler&apos;s List (1993)_ (qv), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.  As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as _The Mask of Zorro (1998)_ (qv), _Men in Black (1997)_ (qv) and _Deep Impact (1998)_ (qv). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic _Amistad (1997)_ (qv), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to _Shakespeare in Love (1998)_ (qv).  Spielberg produced a series of films, including _Evolution (2001)_ (qv), _The Haunting (1999)_ (qv) and _Shrek (2001)_ (qv). he also produced two sequels to _Jurassic Park (1993)_ (qv), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: _&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001)_ (qv), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director&apos;s chair for _Artificial Intelligence: AI (2001)_ (qv), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.  Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series _&quot;SeaQuest DSV&quot; (1993)_ (qv), an anthology series entitled _&quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (1985)_ (qv), created the video-game series &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of _&quot;ER&quot; (1994)_ (qv). Spielberg, if you haven&apos;t noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) collaborated on _Shooting War (2000) (TV)_ (qv), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called _A Holocaust szemei (2000)_ (qv). With all of this to Spielberg&apos;s credit, it&apos;s no wonder that he&apos;s looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.</biography>

      <biography>Cyrus King was born in Redwood City, California in the summer of 1978. Home-grown in San Francisco&apos;s East Bay area, his father is a Persian engineer and his mother an Irish-German nurse. They settled in Hayward, a suburb of Oakland and Cyrus soon started to learn the hard knocks of blue collar life.  Cruising through school without giving acting much thought, he managed to take and pass a drama class his freshman year in high school; the only class he would actually pass that year. It wouldn&apos;t be until the age of twenty while attending college in Chico, California that he would be cast in numerous short films and plays, some of which won awards at local film festivals.  Deciding that a college degree wouldn&apos;t necessarily guarantee work, he stepped up to the L.A. arena in 2001, and since then he&apos;s been featured on the hit shows E.R., nip/tuck, and C.S.I.: Miami.  Great roles in feature films are no stranger to him either; they include: an FBI agent in Steven Spielberg&apos;s &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot;, and an M.P. (Military Police) in Academy Award winning director Errol Morris&apos; &quot;Standard Operating Procedure&quot;.  Known for his hard-knock, authoritative and military characters and his clever takes on life, Cyrus&apos; style of story-telling through film will continue to be action-packed, dramatic and comical.</biography>

His real movie career began in 1994 when he woke up one morning and decided to drive to Hollywood to try and get in the first Flintstone&apos;s movie, figuring he would make a good Neanderthal. Filming had ended on the Flintstone&apos;s (he did land a part in the second Flintstone&apos;s movie &quot;Viva Rock Vegas&quot;), but two days later he was working his first movie, Steven Seagal&apos;s &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot;, in a scene with Michael Caine. Bob currently resides in Laughlin with his beautiful wife, Cherie. They both work actively in movies and TV.

She starred in the cult 1980s NBC/PBS series _&quot;High Feather&quot; (1980)_ (qv).

      <birthName>Pepper, Barry Robert</birthName>
      <biography>Barry Robert Pepper was born on April 4, 1970, in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada, as the youngest of three sons. He has two older brothers named Alex and Doug Pepper. The Peppers didn&apos;t stick around Campbell River for too long. They had been building a ship in their backyard for years. When Barry was five years old, the ship was done and the family set sail. The ship, named &quot;The Moonlighter,&quot; was a 50-foot craft that would be their home for the next five years. They navigated through the South Pacific islands, using only a sextant and the stars as guides. While visiting such exotic locales as Fiji and Tahiti, Barry was educated through correspondence courses and sometimes enrolled in public schools. He grew up around Polynesian children and credits them for his love of dance, music and other expressive arts. Barry had plenty of time to practice his newfound loves, too. Without television as entertainment on the ship, the family relied on games and sketch acting for fun. When the five-year cruise was over, the Peppers returned to their native Canada, where they set up shop on a small island off the West Coast near Vancouver. They built a farm on the outskirts of a small artists&apos; town, which was populated mainly by hippies, poets, musicians and other craftsmen. While in high school, Barry was enthusiastic about art and excelled in sports. In addition to playing volleyball, he was an excellent rugby player. He graduated in 1988 from George P. Vanier High School in Courtenay and then enrolled in college and majored in marketing and graphic design, but after getting involved with the Vancouver Actors Studio, he changed his course. Once again, he was using &quot;the stars&quot; to navigate. Barry landed his first role on _&quot;Madison&quot; (1993)_ (qv) (a sort of Canadian 90210) and other prominent television series before moving on to more prestigious roles in the US. Television movies followed, most notably the mini-series _Titanic (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which costarred &apos;George C. Scott&apos; (qv). Still, Barry&apos;s career really wasn&apos;t taking off. He was a hard-working actor, but not a star. That all changed in 1998. After a string of big screen duds, Pepper obtained his breakthrough role as a Bible-quoting sniper in &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s WW II drama _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). With the success of the film came sudden stardom for its cast--complete with photo spreads, interviews and even some Oscar buzz. Barry followed the film with a small but noteworthy role in the blockbuster, _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Will Smith (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gene Hackman&apos; (qv). Next he co-starred in an Oscar-worthy film starring &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv): &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Green Mile (1999)_ (qv). Barry received much critical acclaim in 2001 for his portrayal of &apos;Roger Maris (I)&apos; (qv) in the made-for-cable drama about the 1961 home run race between Maris and &apos;Mickey Mantle&apos; (qv) called _61* (2001) (TV)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>James Martin Kelly was born in 1954 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. Within a few years he moved to suburban Valley Stream, Long Island where at the age of 11 he performed on stage as a musician singing, playing the guitar and drums. By the 1980s Jim was a published songwriter and performer working in the recording studios and nightclubs of New York in lower Manhattan. To supplement his income and now married to Mary-Ellen of Long Island and with children, Jim became a postman with the US Postal Service. He secured a transfer to Hudson, Florida, but once there he realized there were many less opportunities in the music industry that he loved so much. His wife saw an advertisement on the television for auditions for the community theater and encouraged Jim to go, where he soon learned the trade of rejection. But he didn&apos;t give up. He played Beadle in &quot;Sweeny Todd&quot; at the Richey Suncoast Theater. A director of another show saw Jim and booked him in his show, this led to one engagement after another including Alan Squire in &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;. Jim at this time had agents in the Tampa area and they were sending him out on several auditions landing him work in commercials. Being in constant demand he had to make the choice whether to take the risk and leave the Post Office or pursue his acting career full time. He chose the latter and has no regrets at all. He decided to go with the agent that got him the best and most consistent work, which was Melanie Hurt of the Hurt Agency, Orlando. He has attended workshops with Kathy Laughlin in Tampa, Lori Wyman in Miami and several others. He spent 3 years learning the Eric Morris Technique at the Performers Studio perfecting scene study. Recently he attended a Primetime Audition workshop in New York with &apos;Julie Tucker&apos; who casts for the TV show _&quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (1999) _. Jim has appeared on _&quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1993)_ (qv) as mob boss Billy Bob Jackson in three episodes where his New York accent came in handy. He also appeared in _&quot;Safe Harbor&quot; (1999)_ (qv). In _&quot;Noah Knows Best&quot; (2000)_ (qv), shot at Universal, he played Big Frankie, Hanson&apos;s bodyguard. Jim played &quot;Mack&apos; the owner of the Big Ace Saloon on _&quot;Dawson&apos;s Creek&quot; (1998)_ (qv). In between theater and television, he hosted his own show: &quot;Kelly&apos;s Cellar&quot;, on public television, when he and his wife produced the series. His guests consisted of comedians, musicians and actors and ran for two years.  Some of his films include _Olive Juice (2001)_ (qv), which recently premiered in Orlando. In _Animal Factory (2000)_ (qv) with &apos;Steve Buscemi&apos; (qv) and &apos;Willem Dafoe&apos; (qv), he played a correctional guard who has a rough face-to-face confrontation with Davoe. His most recent film, shot in Miami, was _Big Trouble (2002)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Barry Sonnerfeld&apos;, when he played a Geo Salesman trying to sell a car. He also has a film To Kill A Lawyer (2001) soon to be shown at the Tampa Bay Film Festival. The film was shot in Tarpon Springs.  Jim is very proud of his eighteen-year-old daughter Amanda who was given a full scholarship to Southern Methodist University for vocal performance. Music seems to run in the family. His sixteen-year-old daughter, Vanessa, is interested in acting and film. Her fascination seems to be in continuity in films. Thirteen-year-old Jim Jr. is into painting, sculpting and now his historical interest is in building ancient medieval armaments. Colin, twelve, is into skateboarding.

      <birthDateAsString>17 September 1954</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Born in Memphis and raised in Philadelphia, Wendy started making student films in the summer of 1969 and began acting because she wanted to be able to write for and direct other actors. She discovered a love of acting that became a lifetime commitment, but only turned into a full-time pursuit when Jonathan Demme came to town to follow up his Academy Award with a groundbreaking drama about AIDS starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington.  Although she ended up on the cutting room floor of the movie &quot;Philadelphia,&quot; the experience gave her her SAG card and convinced her that it was time to leave behind her career as an arts administrator (co-founder of CineKyd, executive director of The Clay Studio, and various managerial jobs at People&apos;s Light and Theatre Company) and pursue acting full-time. Two weeks after arriving in Los Angeles, she was cast in a new musical, &quot;Lulu,&quot; for which she received a Drama-Logue Award, the first of many awards to come. Within a year, she had landed her first TV job, an appearance on &quot;Murphy Brown.&quot;  She continued to work regularly in TV and in theatre (helping to found Theatre Neo with Kathryn Joosten, Josh Schiowitz, and others), playing a wide range of roles from the murderous Lunch Lady on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (which earned her an appearance on her own trading card) to a recurring role as the formidable Margaret Camaro on &quot;Ally McBeal,&quot; &quot;Foodzilla&quot; on &quot;Even Stevens,&quot; and Miss Westmore (&quot;The Wicked Witch of the Westmore&quot;), teacher to the Olsen Twins on their most recent series, &quot;So Little Time.&quot;  She also began to make her mark in feature films, including a memorable turn as a lascivious casting director in &quot;LA Twister&quot; and Lenore, a high school receptionist described as &quot;cheerful and dumb as a stump&quot; in the upcoming drama &quot;In the Valley of Elah,&quot; written and directed by Academy Award winner Paul Haggis (&quot;Crash&quot;) and appearing opposite Tommy Lee Jones.  Wendy has the distinction of having played small roles in four different Tom Hanks movies: &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (don&apos;t look for her there, though, as she was edited out), &quot;Cast Away&quot; (in which she played one of Helen Hunt&apos;s aunts joining in the Christmas dinner early in the film), &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (a quick turn as a receptionist at TWA in a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio), and the soon-to-be-released &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; (in the memorable role of &quot;Oregon Woman&quot;).  Wendy is also a talented and experienced theatre director (her BA from Temple University, awarded summa cum laude, is in Radio-TV-Film) and a singer. And, although she grew up there, she does not have a Philadelphia accent - but she can do one on request.</biography>

      <birthName>Taylor, Rodney Sturt</birthName>
      <biography>Suave and handsome Australian actor who came to Hollywood in the 1950s, and built himself up from a supporting actor into taking the lead in several well-remembered movies. Arguably his most fondly remembered role was that as George (Herbert George Wells), the inventor, in &apos;George Pal&apos; (qv)&apos;s spectacular _The Time Machine (1960)_ (qv). As the movie finished with George, and his best friend Filby &apos;Alan Young (I)&apos; (qv) seemingly parting forever, both actors were brought back together in 1993 to film a 30 minute epilogue to the original movie! Taylor&apos;s virile, matinée idol looks also assisted him in scoring the lead of Mitch Brenner in &apos;Alfred Hitchcock (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s creepy thriller _The Birds (1963)_ (qv), the role of &apos;Jane Fonda&apos; (qv)&apos;s love interest in _Sunday in New York (1963)_ (qv), the title role in &apos;John Ford (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s biopic of Irish playwright &apos;Sean O&apos;Casey&apos; (qv) in _Young Cassidy (1965)_ (qv), and a co-starring role in _The Train Robbers (1973)_ (qv) with &apos;John Wayne (I)&apos; (qv). Taylor also appeared as &apos;Bette Davis&apos; (qv) future son-in-law in the well-received film _The Catered Affair (1956)_ (qv). He also gave a sterling performance as the German-American Nazi Major trying to fool &apos;James Garner (I)&apos; (qv) in _36 Hours (1965)_ (qv). Later Taylor made many westerns and action movies during the 1960s and 1970s; however, none of them were much better than &quot;B pictures&quot; and failed to push his star to the next level. Aditionally, Taylor was cast as the lead in several TV series including _&quot;Bearcats!&quot; (1971)_ (qv), _&quot;Masquerade&quot; (1983)_ (qv), and _&quot;Outlaws&quot; (1986)_ (qv); however, none of them truly ignited viewer interest, and they were canceled after only one or two seasons. Most fans would agree that Rod Taylor&apos;s last great role was in the wonderful Australian film _The Picture Show Man (1977)_ (qv), about a traveling side show bringing &quot;moving pictures&quot; to remote towns in the Australian outback.</biography>

      <biography>Jillian Clare is an award winning actress originally from the beautiful Pacific Northwest. At five years old Jillian began singing and dancing on stage winning accolades and numerous vocal talent awards. Her acting career began when she was 6, entertaining audiences performing in a one person original musical titled &apos;A Dream is a Wish&apos;.  Upon arriving in Los Angeles with her parents at age 8, Jillian quickly began working in commercials plus the big and small screen in numerous films and television shows including her double award winning portrayal of pre-teen &apos;Abby Deveraux&apos; on NBC&apos;s _&quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1965)_ (qv), back in 2003 and 2004. Most recently Jillian has been seen in guest star stints for ABC&apos;s _&quot;Castle&quot; (2009)_ (qv) and Nickelodeon&apos;s Emmy nominated episodes of _&quot;Victorious&quot; (2010)_ (qv) titled Freak The Freak Out.  No stranger to the stage either, her background includes lead roles in musicals, original pieces, an extended run as &apos;Scout&apos; in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; at just 11 years old and most recently an appearance as &apos;Nuna&apos; in the groundbreaking &apos;Eve Ensler&apos; (qv) play &quot;Necessary Targets&quot; starring as a Bosnian refugee.  In early 2010, Miss Clare joined the ranks of New Media and began producing and starring in the multi-award winning teen series _&quot;Miss Behave&quot; (2010)_ (qv), a role that won her &quot;Best Lead Actress in a Drama&quot; at the 2011 International Television Festival. After three seasons, the show has garnered a vast worldwide fan base, and received over 40 awards and nominations, including several producing accolades.  Jillian continues to find success in feature films with several starring roles of late including the recently released comedy, _The Kitchen (2012)_ (qv), alongside &apos;Laura Prepon&apos; (qv) and&apos;Bryan Greenberg&apos; plus the upcoming holiday feature, _By God&apos;s Grace (2014)_ (qv). Miss Clare will be seen starring in the highly anticipated thriller, &apos;Project Blue Book (2013)&apos;, by famed producers &apos;Lawrence Bender&apos; (qv) and &apos;Mike Fleiss&apos; (qv) followed by the indie horror film Cora, with Jillian in the title role.  Aside from performing, Jillian lends her support to a variety of causes geared toward children and her four-legged friends.

      <biography>With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most respected figures in modern US cinema. Born in June 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, the young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.  Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of &apos;Lee Breuer&apos; (qv)&apos;s The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in &apos;Alfred Uhry&apos; (qv)&apos;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival&apos;s The Taming of the Shrew, opposite &apos;Tracey Ullman&apos; (qv). Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with &apos;Frances McDormand&apos; (qv) and &apos;Peter Gallagher (I)&apos; (qv) in &apos;Clifford Odets&apos; (qv)&apos; drama The Country Girl, directed by &apos;Mike Nichols (I)&apos; (qv).  Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including &quot;Easy Reader&quot;, &quot;Mel Mounds&quot; and &quot;Count Dracula&quot; on the Children&apos;s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show _&quot;The Electric Company&quot; (1971)_ (qv). He then moved into feature film with another children&apos;s adventure, _Who Says I Can&apos;t Ride a Rainbow! (1971)_ (qv). Next, there was a small role in the thriller _Blade (1973)_ (qv); then he played Casca in _Julius Caesar (1979) (V)_ (qv) and the title role in _Coriolanus (1979) (V)_ (qv). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas _Attica (1980) (TV)_ (qv) and _Brubaker (1980)_ (qv), _Eyewitness (1981)_ (qv), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in _Death of a Prophet (1981) (TV)_ (qv). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in _Street Smart (1987)_ (qv) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of _Driving Miss Daisy (1989)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Jessica Tandy&apos; (qv). The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful &apos;Matthew Broderick (I)&apos; (qv) and fiery &apos;Denzel Washington&apos; (qv) in the epic Civil War drama _Glory (1989)_ (qv) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.  His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in _The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)_ (qv), _Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)_ (qv), and _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). Freeman&apos;s next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv)&apos;s de-mythologized western _Unforgiven (1992)_ (qv). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for &apos;Gene Hackman&apos; (qv), a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on _Bopha! (1993)_ (qv) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.  More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker &apos;Tim Robbins (I)&apos; (qv) in _The Shawshank Redemption (1994)_ (qv). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in _Se7en (1995)_ (qv), starred alongside &apos;Keanu Reeves&apos; (qv) in _Chain Reaction (1996)_ (qv), and was pursuing another serial murderer in _Kiss the Girls (1997)_ (qv).  Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of _Amistad (1997)_ (qv), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in _Deep Impact (1998)_ (qv), appeared in &apos;Neil LaBute&apos; (qv)&apos;s black comedy _Nurse Betty (2000)_ (qv), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in _Along Came a Spider (2001)_ (qv). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama _The Sum of All Fears (2002)_ (qv), was a military officer in the &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv)-inspired _Dreamcatcher (2003)_ (qv), gave divine guidance as God to &apos;Jim Carrey&apos; (qv) in _Bruce Almighty (2003)_ (qv), and played a minor role in the comedy _The Big Bounce (2004)_ (qv).  2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv) to appear in the drama, _Million Dollar Baby (2004)_ (qv). Freeman&apos;s on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie &quot;Scrap Iron&quot; Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv). Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy&apos;s judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s _War of the Worlds (2005)_ (qv) and appeared in _Batman Begins (2005)_ (qv) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of &apos;Christian Bale&apos; (qv)&apos;s Bruce Wayne/Batman for director &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv). Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.  Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in _Lucky Number Slevin (2006)_ (qv), a second go-round as God in _Evan Almighty (2007)_ (qv) with &apos;Steve Carell&apos; (qv) taking over for &apos;Jim Carrey&apos; (qv), and a supporting role in &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv)&apos;s directorial debut, _Gone Baby Gone (2007)_ (qv). He co-starred with &apos;Jack Nicholson (I)&apos; (qv) in the breakout hit _The Bucket List (2007)_ (qv) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, _Wanted (2008)_ (qv), then segued into the second Batman film, _The Dark Knight (2008)_ (qv).  In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director&apos;s true-life drama _Invictus (2009)_ (qv), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of &apos;Nelson Mandela&apos; (qv) in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics&apos; Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.  Recently, Freeman appeared in _RED (2010)_ (qv), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the _Conan the Barbarian (2011)_ (qv) remake, starred in &apos;Rob Reiner&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Magic of Belle Isle (2012)_ (qv); and capped the Batman trilogy with _The Dark Knight Rises (2012)_ (qv). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller _Now You See Me (2013/I)_ (qv), under the direction of &apos;Louis Leterrier&apos; (qv), and the science fiction actioner _Oblivion (2013/I)_ (qv), in which he stars with &apos;Tom Cruise&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Jamie&apos;s mother, Louise, was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed, his grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age 7 months, adopted him too. He says he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, &quot;Peep This&quot; and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _&quot;Roc&quot; (1991)_ (qv) and _&quot;In Living Color&quot; (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series. He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.</biography>

      <biography>David Austin grew up in a small town in Minnesota. He was inspired to be an actor at an early age by his great-grandfather &apos;George Irving (I)&apos; (qv), a very prominent actor and director of the early 20th century. As a child his interest in piano led him to win the Minnesota State Piano Competition, where he played at the Northrup Auditorium in front of 10,000 people. Fascinated by &apos;Bruce Lee (I)&apos; (qv), he trained hard to become a black belt at age 16 and went on to win many awards for performance demonstrations. Always into extreme sports, as a student in Santa Barbara,CA, he would often swim miles out into the ocean and surprise ships at sea with a visit. One swim out to an oil rig almost ended in tragedy when a storm broke out while he and his friend were swimming seven miles offshore. Miraculously they survived! This story was featured and re-enacted on the PAX television show _&quot;It&apos;s a Miracle&quot; (1998)_ (qv) and also featured on &apos;Warren Miller (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s television show &quot;Wild Survival&quot;. David completed principal photography on the WW II feature _Lorelei (2005)_ (qv), in which he plays an earnest young Executive Officer on the USS Fleischer. The film broke a number of box-office records in Japan and is in negotiation for release in the U.S.</biography>

His first name is Christopher, and he hated being called Chris in school, so he changed it to Topher as time went on. He attended New Hampshire&apos;s Brewster Academy and the University of Southern California.  Grace dropped out of USC to start his show business career in _&quot;That &apos;70s Show&quot; (1998)_ (qv) at age 20.

      <birthName>Llewelyn, Desmond Wilkinson</birthName>
      <biography>Desmond Llewelyn was born in South Wales in 1914, the son of a coal mining engineer. In high school, he worked as a stagehand in the school&apos;s productions and then picked up sporadic small parts. His family would not give up their effort to prevent him from a life on stage, so an uncle who was a high ranking police officer arranged for Llewelyn to take the department&apos;s physical exam. &quot;Thank God, I flunked the eye test, and they wouldn&apos;t take me. I suspect the inspector had a hangover because he also failed this other chap I knew, who went out the same day and passed the physical for the Royal Navy, which had a lot tougher test.&quot; After failing the police exam, Llewelyn thought about becoming a minister, realizing after a week-long retreat of quiet and meditation that the ministry &quot;was definitely not for me.&quot; Llewelyn persevered in his acting quest, and was accepted to the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in the mid 1930s. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939, halted his acting career, and Llewelyn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the British army. He was assigned to the Royal Welsh Fusiliers and was sent to France in early 1940. In a short time, his regiment was fighting the Germans, and Llewelyn&apos;s company was holding off a division of German tanks. Llewelyn explained that &quot;eventually, the tanks broke through and many of us jumped into this canal and started swimming down it to the other side, figuring that our chaps were still over there. But the Germans were the only ones there,&quot; and Llewelyn was captured, and held as a prisoner of war for five years. At one prison camp, the prisoners had dug a tunnel and were planning to escape the next morning. Llewelyn was down in the tunnel doing some maintenance work in preparation of the escape when the Germans found out about the tunnel and caught him down in it, a crime that earned Llewelyn 10 days in solitary, which Llewelyn called &quot;a blessing of sorts. After spending every day of several years sleeping in a room with 50 other people, the quiet and privacy was rather nice.&quot; After the war, Llewelyn returned to London and revived his career, eventually being cast as his trademark Q in _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv). Since 1963, Llewelyn has appeared as Q in every Eon Productions Bond film, except _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Llewelyn was omitted from _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) because producers &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Albert R. Broccoli&apos; (qv) felt that too much was being made of the gadgets and they would play it down. Llewelyn said he &quot;was quite disappointed&quot; at being left out of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv). Fans, however, missed Q, and Llewelyn got a call shortly after the release of _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) telling him that he would be in the next Bond film, _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). Llewelyn, who admits that his mechanical abilities in real life are virtually nil, is geared up for the next Bond movie. &quot;I&apos;d love to be in the next one,&quot; Llewelyn said. &quot;Of course, if you consider my age, they should have put me out to grass a long time ago.&quot;</biography>

      <birthName>Adams, Amy Lou</birthName>
      <biography>Amy Lou Adams was born in Italy, to American parents Kathryn (Hicken) and Richard Kent Adams, while her father was a U.S. serviceman. She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado.  Adams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder&apos;s Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as &quot;Brigadoon&quot; and &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;. It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theater work.  Nursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in _Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)_ (qv), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, &apos;Kirstie Alley&apos; (qv) encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, _Cruel Intentions (1999)_ (qv), in the part played in the film by &apos;Sarah Michelle Gellar&apos; (qv), &quot;Kathryn Merteuil&quot;. Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video _Cruel Intentions 2 (2000) (V)_ (qv). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv), playing opposite &apos;Leonardo DiCaprio&apos; (qv). But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, _&quot;Dr. Vegas&quot; (2004)_ (qv).  Her role in the low-budget independent film _Junebug (2005)_ (qv) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of &quot;Giselle&quot; in the animated/live-action feature film, _Enchanted (2007)_ (qv), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.  Adams next appeared in the major production, _Charlie Wilson&apos;s War (2007)_ (qv), and went on to act in the independent film, _Sunshine Cleaning (2008)_ (qv), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as &quot;Sister James&quot; in _Doubt (2008/I)_ (qv) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as &apos;Amelia Earhart&apos; (qv) in _Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009)_ (qv) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in _Julie &amp; Julia (2009)_ (qv). More recently, she starred with &apos;Jason Segel&apos; (qv) in _The Muppets (2011)_ (qv) and alongside &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv) in _Trouble with the Curve (2012)_ (qv).</biography>

During her teenage years, she was part of the Masquerade and Miskin theater companies, appearing in productions of The Massacre of Civitella and Guiding Star. In 2004, she won an award for Best Supporting Actress, which helped her to win a grant to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).  Whilst studying at RADA, she landed her first professional role in _Capturing Mary (2007) (TV)_ (qv), directed by &apos;Stephen Poliakoff (I)&apos; (qv) and starring &apos;Maggie Smith (I)&apos; (qv). Gemma graduated from RADA in 2007 and won her first film role in _St. Trinian&apos;s (2007)_ (qv). Her breakthrough role came in 2008, when she appeared in the James Bond film _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv). In 2009, she was the winner of Empire&apos;s Best Newcomer Award.</biography>

      <biography>Malachi Throne, the character actor who became one of the more ubiquitous faces on television from the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the 1950s through the 21st Century, was born in New York City on December 1, 1928, the son of Samuel and Rebecca Throne, who had immigrated to America from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He began performing at an early age.  During World War Two, the young Malachi quit school to work in theater, though he later returned and got his high school diploma. He then set out upon a life as a &quot;wandering player&quot;, as he describes it, playing in summer and winter stock companies while matriculating at Brooklyn College and Long Island University. Though he loved acting, he believed he&apos;d eventually wind up as an English teacher, which is why he doggedly kept at his studies between tours.  When he was 21 years old, the Korean Conflict broke out, and Throne wound up in the infantry attached to an armored unit. When he returned to the New York theatrical scene, he found out that the revolution &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) had started in 1947 playing Stanley Kowalski in _A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)_ (qv) was now the status quo.  Possessed of a deep, classically trained voice, Throne was cast in the parts of characters much older than his actual age. His clear enunciation also made him a natural for live television, and he went to work on the now-defunct DuMont TV network. He continued his acting studies in New York, tutored by such luminaries as &apos;Uta Hagen&apos; (qv) and &apos;William Hickey (I)&apos; (qv).  In addition to TV, he continued to work on the the stage, appearing in the landmark Off-Broadway production of Eugene O&apos;Neill&apos;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, in support of &apos;Jason Robards&apos; (qv). He also played in the famous Off-Broadway revivals of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; and &apos;Clifford Odets&apos; (qv)&apos; &quot;Rocket To The Moon&quot;, as well as appeared on Broadway in such top shows as &apos;Jean Anouilh (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Becket&quot; in support of &apos;Laurence Olivier&apos; (qv).  In 1958-59, he found himself in California, playing a season at San Deigo&apos;s Old Globe Theater. After his stint with the Globe was over, he went north, to Hollywood, and established himself as a major character actor in guest spots on series television during the 1960s. He had memorable appearances as &quot;Falseface&quot; on the Batman TV series and provided the voice of &quot;The Keeper&quot; for &quot;The Cage&quot;, the pilot episode of the _&quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966)_ (qv) series. He turned down an offer to be a regular cast member on that show, rejecting the part of Dr. McCoy as he did not want to play third fiddle to &apos;William Shatner&apos; (qv) and &apos;Leonard Nimoy&apos; (qv). Producer &apos;Gene Roddenberry&apos; (qv), who had offered him the role of &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy, was not offended by Throne turning him down, and cast him as &quot;Commodore Mendez&quot; in the two-part episode &quot;The Menagerie&quot;, which included most of the original pilot, although by then The Keeper&apos;s voice had been re-dubbed by another actor. He also later played &quot;Senator Pardac&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; two-part episode &quot;Unification,&quot; appearing with Leonard Nimoy, whose Mr. Spock was the role he had coveted a generation before.  In 1968, two years after &quot;Star Trek&quot; debuted, Throne was cast as &apos;Robert Wagner (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s boss on the TV show _&quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; (1968)_ (qv) while continuing to guest on other TV shows. Throne also remained committed to the stage, appearing as a resident actor with a variety of regional theaters, including the SanFrancisco Actors&apos; Workshop, the Los Angeles Inner City Repertory Co., the MarkTaper Forum and the Louisville Free Theatre.  Malachi Throne lives in southern California, where he appears in local theater. When not acting, he writes historical novels. His two sons are also in show business: Zachary Throne is an actor/musician while Joshua Throne is a Producer/Unit Production Manager.</biography>

      <birthName>Walken, Ronald</birthName>
      <biography>Amazingly versatile stage &amp; screen actor with sandy colored hair, pale complexion and a somewhat nervous disposition. Has a reputation for playing mentally unbalanced characters on-screen, however that generalisation would not do justice to Walken&apos;s depth and breadth of performances. He learnt his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University &amp; ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the &apos;Tennessee Williams&apos; (qv) play &quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;.  Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in _Me and My Brother (1969)_ (qv), before appearing alongside &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv) in the sleeper heist movie _The Anderson Tapes (1971)_ (qv). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of &apos;Diane Keaton&apos; (qv) suicidal younger brother in _Annie Hall (1977)_ (qv), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying _The Deer Hunter (1978)_ (qv). Walken was lured back by _The Deer Hunter (1978)_ (qv) director &apos;Michael Cimino (I)&apos; (qv) for a role in the financially disastrous western _Heaven&apos;s Gate (1980)_ (qv), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in _Pennies from Heaven (1981)_ (qv), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the &apos;Stephen King (I)&apos; (qv) inspired _The Dead Zone (1983)_ (qv) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv).  Looking at many of Walken&apos;s other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in _Biloxi Blues (1988)_ (qv), _Wayne&apos;s World 2 (1993)_ (qv), _Joe Dirt (2001)_ (qv), _Mousehunt (1997)_ (qv) and _America&apos;s Sweethearts (2001)_ (qv). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to &apos;Leonardo DiCaprio&apos; (qv) in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv). Christopher Walken&apos;s talents continue to remain in high demand and movie audiences relish watching how capably he re-invents himself for each new challenging role.</biography>

      <biography>The daughter of noted producer &apos;Bruce Paltrow&apos; (qv) and Tony award-winning actress &apos;Blythe Danner&apos; (qv), Gwyneth Paltrow was born in 1972 in Los Angeles. When Gwyneth was 11, the family moved to Massachusetts where her father began working in summer stock productions in the Berkshires. It was here that she received her early acting training under the tutelage of her parents. After graduating from the all-girls Spence School in New York City, she moved to California where she attended the University of California in Santa Barbara, majoring in Art History. She soon quit, realizing it was not her passion. In 1990 she made her stage debut in the Williamstown Theatre play, &quot;Picnic&quot;. In 1991 she appeared in her first film, _Shout (1991)_ (qv), with &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv). That same year she met &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv), who gave her a small part in his film _Hook (1991)_ (qv). Her next roles were in made-for-television films, until she won rave reviews for her performance in _Flesh and Bone (1993)_ (qv). In 1994, she entered into a relationship with &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv), the older (by nine years) superstar who gave her a career boost by choosing her to play his wife in the hit thriller _Se7en (1995)_ (qv). But it was the title role of Emma Woodhouse in _Emma (1996)_ (qv) that fully tapped Gwyneth&apos;s capabilities and established her as a serious actress. She and Pitt broke off their much publicized engagement in 1997, citing as the reason the fact that neither felt that they could pursue their respective careers and at the same time maintain a happy marriage. They remain good friends. Meanwhile, Gwyneth&apos;s career has gone through the roof with the release of five glossy films in 1998, including _Great Expectations (1998)_ (qv), _Sliding Doors (1998)_ (qv), _A Perfect Murder (1998)_ (qv), and &apos;John Madden (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s masterpiece, _Shakespeare in Love (1998)_ (qv). Gwyneth&apos;s outstanding performance in the last film marked the greatest triumph of her career to date. She won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role.</biography>

      <biography>Wade Eastwood was born in Durban, South Africa in 1971, the youngest of 4 children. He finished junior school there before his family moved to England. The weather and lifestyle eventually forced a family decision to move back home to SA after 5 years. Once home, Wade finished high school, represented his country in Athletics (100M &amp; 200M sprints) and went in to the Army to complete his compulsory National Service.  Wade was 19 when he finished the army and landed his first film job. He had been working as a volunteer lifeguard and part of his duty included air sea rescue along Durban&apos;s beaches. A film company came to town and was scouting for soldier types to jump out of a helicopter as it flared to a stop over a crocodile infested river. Wade was chosen by the Director. After this stunt he was hooked and worked his way, (The hard way) through the ranks, driving, crashing, falling, burning etc....  After 7 years of performing and stunt coordinating feature films, TV shows and commercial&apos;s in South Africa, Wade wanted to move on to bigger and better projects with larger budgets and more scope to create unique action, thus he moved to the UK. Here he worked back to back doubling Brendan Fraser on The Mummy, Pierce Brosnan on The Bond Movies and Gerard Butler and Daniel Craig on The Tomb Raider Films, to name a few.  The only thing missing for Wade was the outdoor life, so he decided to make the move to California where he could work and still enjoy his hometown sports, such as surfing, climbing, motorcycle &amp; car racing etc...  Since moving to Los Angeles, Wade has stunt doubled Brad Pitt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ewan McGregor and many others as well as been nominated for 4 Taurus World Stunt awards for Best Stunt Coordination (Troy), best overall stunt by a stuntman (Terminator 3), best work with a vehicle (Terminator 3) and Best Stunt Coordinator (Salt).</biography>

      <biography>Dana Gourrier (pronounced Gu-Ree-A) is a native of New Orleans with ancestry dating back 7 generations. Since 8 years old she has been in front of audiences performing: be it singing, dancing, or acting. Her true love of theater began when she was 14 years old at the New Orleans Recreational Department Theater under the program&apos;s long-time, late director, Ty Tracy. After receiving her BFA in Performance Art from UL Lafayette, she went to New York in higher pursuits. She continued her studies participating in a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw Shakespeare in the Park&apos;s Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York. Eventually she found a tiny studio in Spanish Harlem, waited tables, auditioned, gigged, did background vocals, and even taught theater at a community center in Brooklyn. Dana has performed and also produced original work at: The Red Room Theater, Birdland, Lennox Lounge, Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, Under St. Mark&apos;s, The Cherry Lane Theater, Summer Stages in Central Park, and La Mama Theater. At La Mama Theater, Dana was apart of a project called Soulagraphie: a series of plays about genocide written by renowned playwright Eric Ehn. She played the title character Maria Kizito: a play about a Rwandan Nun that was tried and convicted of aiding in the death of thousands.  In 2010, Dana completed her MFA in Acting from the reputable California Institute of the Arts, where she was in two world premieres and a long list of other full theatrical productions both Classic and Contemporary. Upon graduating, she came straight home and broke into Hollywood South, as Film and Television were also her great loves. Dana had one goal when deciding to move back home; it was to be on HBO&apos;s Treme; the David Simon executively produced show about her hometown. Not only was she on it, but she landed a recurring role.  Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood&apos;s biggest Academy Award Winners and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino&apos;s Django Unchained. She felt so welcomed and connected to Quentin. She pitched ideas about her character to him, including a song for the funeral scene, which was shot, but would eventually land on the cutting room floor. Her next endeavor was working with Nominee Lee Daniels&apos; on his film, The Butler. She portrayed the role of Helen Holloway, wife of James Holloway, played by Lenny Kravitz.  Additionally, Dana has worked directly with Academy Award Winners and Nominees: Angela Bassett, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Woody Harrelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Lang, Christoph Waltz, Forest Whitaker, and Oprah Winfrey!  Dana considers herself Tri-Costal, but currently resides in New Orleans, which will always be home.</biography>

      <biography>After leaving school, Richard joined the ABC in Sydney with hopes of emulating his father, Jack Bruce, who worked as a cinematographer in Hollywood for Cecil B. De Mille and the Famous Lansky Players. However, the only opening at the time was in editing. He fell in love with the craft and spent 15 years with the ABC working on various current affairs and other programs before getting into drama. He left the ABC to work on the feature &quot;Goodbye Paradise&quot; before going on to &quot;Careful He Might Hear You&quot; and Kennedy Miller&apos;s &quot;The Dismissal&quot; and &quot;Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome&quot;. It was through George Miller&apos;s studio film &quot;The Witches of Eastwick that Richard was introduced to Hollywood. He again worked for Miller on his 1992 film &quot;Lorenzo&apos;s Oil&quot;. Richard got the job on &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot; over 30 of Hollywood&apos;s best editors because the producer had a similar background (at the BBC) and took a liking to him. In June/July 1996 Richard visited Australia for the first time in four years and during that time spoke at a seminar at the Australian Film Television and Radio School entitled Frame By Frame, where he took the audience cut by cut through every aspect of the production of &quot;Seven&quot;. He was also interviewed for the ABC- TV program &quot;Review&quot;. Richard was also nominated for the Eddies (American Cinema Editor&apos;s Awards) for his work on &quot;Shawshank&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot; and in 1997 Richard was invited to become a member of the American Cinema Editors. In 1998 he received his third Oscar nomination for his work on &quot;Air Force One&quot;, a fact which attracted considerable attention by the Australian TV and press. However, although it was hoped he would be third time lucky, the Oscar went to the blockbuster of the year Titanic. In 2001 he was again nominated by the Americian Cinema Editor&apos;s for his work on &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&apos;s Stone .</biography>

      <birthName>Conn, Catherine</birthName>
      <biography>Kitty Carlisle Hart wore a cloak of many professional and elegant colors. Actress, opera singer, Broadway performer, TV celebrity, game show panelist, patron of the arts, and, at age 95, this vital woman continued her six-decade musical odyssey with songs and reminisces in her one-woman show: &quot;Kitty Carlisle Hart: An American Icon,&quot; which toured from her beloved New York to Los Angeles. She developed pneumonia soon after her tour folded toward the end of 2006 and passed away of congestive heart failure in April of 2007.  The New Orleans-born Carlisle Hart was born on September 3, 1910, and baptized Catherine Conn (pronounced Cohen), her family being of German Jewish ancestry. Her father, Dr. Joseph Conn, was a gynecologist who died when she was only ten. Her very ambitious mother, Hortense, escorted Kitty to Europe in 1921 with the intentions of marrying her off &apos;Grace Kelly (I)&apos; (qv) style into European royalty. When that plan didn&apos;t pan out, they stayed in Europe where Kitty received her adult education in Switzerland, London, Paris and Rome. She finally zeroed in on her acting career after being accepted into London&apos;s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and also went on to train at the Theatre de l&apos;Atelier in Paris.  She and her mother eventually returned to New York in 1932 wherein she first apprenticed with the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. She attracted notice quite early in her career. Billed as Kitty Carlisle, she found radio work and made her first appearance on the musical stage in the title role of &quot;Rio Rita.&quot; The legitimately-trained singer went on to appear in a number of operettas, including 1933&apos;s &quot;Champagne Sec&quot; (as Prince Orlofsky), as well as the musical comedies &quot;White Horse Inn&quot; (1936) and &quot;Three Waltzes&quot; (1937).  Her early ingénue movie career included warbling in the musical mystery _Murder at the Vanities (1934)_ (qv), and alongside &apos;Allan Jones (I)&apos; (qv) amidst the zany goings-on of the Marx Brothers in the classic farce _A Night at the Opera (1935)_ (qv). She also played a love interest to &apos;Bing Crosby&apos; (qv)&apos;s in two of his lesser known musical outings _Here Is My Heart (1934)_ (qv) and _She Loves Me Not (1934)_ (qv).  Films were not her strong suit, however, and she returned to her theatre roots. Appearing in her first dramatic productions &quot;French Without Tears&quot; and &quot;The Night of January 16th&quot; in 1938, she went on to grace a number of chic and stylish plays and musicals throughout the 40s, including &quot;Walk with Music (1940), &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (1943, &quot;Design for Living (1943) and &quot;There&apos;s Always Juliet&quot; (1944). She subsequently performed in &apos;Benjamin Britten&apos; (qv)&apos;s 1948 American premiere of &quot;The Rape of Lucretia.&quot; In 1946, she married Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright &apos;Moss Hart&apos; (qv) and appeared in a number of his works including his classic &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1949) and the witty Broadway comedy &quot;Anniversary Waltz&quot; (1954). The couple had two children. He died in 1961 and she never remarried, spending much of her existing time keeping his name alive to future generations.  It was the small screen that would make Kitty a welcome household commodity. The steadfast panelist of several quiz shows in the 1950s, it was the popular game show _&quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; (1956)_ (qv) that anointed her game show doyenne and icon. A regular panelist for some 20 years, she appeared on each and every revamped format from its 1956 inception to its 2002 syndicated version. Known for her stately presence, infectious laugh, pouffy dark Prince Valiant hairstyle, and sweeping couture gowns on the show, audiences reveled at her effortless class to these simple parlor games. She also was a substitute panelist for other popular game shows such as &quot;What&apos;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ve Got a Secret.&quot;  In later years, she became an important society maven of New York City, an avid patron and zealous supporter of the performing arts. Appointed to various state-wide councils, she was chairman of the New York State Council of the Arts in 1976 and served in that capacity for 20 years, also serving on the boards of various New York City cultural institutions. A noted lecturer, the civic-minded Carlisle Hart was active in administrative capacities as well, notably as Chairman of Governor Rockefeller&apos;s Conference on Woman (1966) and as special consultant to the Governor on women&apos;s opportunities. At one time she wrote the column &quot;Kitty&apos;s Calendar&quot; for Women&apos;s Unit News.  Kitty never stopped entertaining. Making her Metropolitan debut on New Year&apos;s Eve 1966 as Prince Orlovsky in &quot;Die Fledermaus,&quot; she joined the touring production the following year. She appeared in concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra and appeared with the Boston Opera Company at one point. She added stature to a number of summer stock plays including &quot;Kiss Me Kate,&quot; &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; and her husband&apos;s &quot;Light Up the Sky.&quot; Returning to Broadway as a replacement for &apos;Dina Merrill&apos; (qv) in the 1983 revival of &quot;On Your Toes,&quot; she was later spotted in &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Radio Days (1987)_ (qv) and _Six Degrees of Separation (1993)_ (qv).  Carlisle penned her autobiography, Kitty, in 1984.</biography>

      <birthName>Wopat, Thomas S.</birthName>
      <biography>He&apos;ll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol&apos; boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed, dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking &apos;John Schneider (I)&apos; (qv) was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s series _&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows.  The highly engaging Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951. Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.  Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;, other book shows came his way including &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot; and the lead in &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn&apos;t take long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons, although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn&apos;t the same without them and they eventually were brought back. During the show&apos;s run, Tom kick-started his recording career with his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.  After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as &apos;Cybill Shepherd&apos; (qv)&apos; ex-husband/stuntman on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills. He returned with commanding baritone leads in &quot;Carousel&quot; (1986), &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1990) and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting Frank Butler role opposite &apos;Bernadette Peters&apos; (qv) in the popular Broadway revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and earned a Tony nomination in the process.  It&apos;s only gotten sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras in programs featuring Broadway&apos;s finest music, he has continued on the New York stage with successive roles in &quot;42nd Street&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot; (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn). In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for &quot;Best Revival of a Play&quot;) production of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; starring acting heavyweights &apos;Alan Alda&apos; (qv) and &apos;Liev Schreiber&apos; (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; tour with &apos;Faith Prince&apos; (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of &apos;Harold Arlen&apos; (qv), a tour that included Carnegie Hall.</biography>

      <birthName>DiCaprio, Leonardo Wilhelm</birthName>
      <biography>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio&apos;s. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv) and &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv). But such a rich, varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring as DiCaprio.  Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist &apos;George DiCaprio (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Irmelin DiCaprio&apos; (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo&apos;s father, George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late &apos;Harvey Pekar&apos;, a friend of George&apos;s. However, Leonardo&apos;s performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name &quot;Lenny Williams&quot;, DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as _&quot;Roseanne&quot; (1988)_ (qv) and _&quot;The New Lassie&quot; (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn&apos;t until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie.  While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio&apos;s acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the &quot;Cousin Oliver&quot; role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio&apos;s stint on _&quot;Growing Pains&quot; (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public&apos;s attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What&apos;s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, &quot;Jim Carroll&quot;, in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late &apos;River Phoenix&apos; (qv) originally expressed interest in.  While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo&apos;s reputation as an actor, it wasn&apos;t until his role as &quot;Romeo&quot; in &apos;Baz Luhrmann&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio&apos;s reputation as a teen heartthrob.  Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv).  With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment.  As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and &apos;Christopher Nolan (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring and challenging actors working today.</biography>

      <biography>John Cleese was born on October 27, 1939, in Weston-Super-Mare, England. He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, &quot;The Goon Show,&quot; starring the legendary &apos;Peter Sellers (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Spike Milligan&apos; (qv), and &apos;Harry Secombe&apos; (qv).  Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university&apos;s legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python &apos;Graham Chapman&apos; (qv). Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name &quot;Cambridge Circus.&quot; When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv), another future Python.  Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, &quot;I&apos;m Sorry, I&apos;ll Read That Again&quot;, based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies &apos;Tim Brooke-Taylor&apos; (qv), &apos;Bill Oddie&apos; (qv) and &apos;Graeme Garden&apos; (qv). He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, &apos;Graham Chapman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Marty Feldman&apos; (qv) in _&quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; (1967)_ (qv), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - &apos;Eric Idle&apos; (qv), &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv), &apos;Terry Jones (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Michael Palin&apos; (qv), and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included _&quot;The Frost Report&quot; (1966)_ (qv) and &apos;Marty Feldman&apos; (qv)&apos;s program _&quot;Marty&quot; (1968)_ (qv). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, _&quot;Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969)_ (qv), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day.  After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - _Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)_ (qv), _Life of Brian (1979)_ (qv), _Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982)_ (qv), and _The Meaning of Life (1983)_ (qv). Cleese and then-wife &apos;Connie Booth (I)&apos; (qv) collaborated in the legendary television series _&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975)_ (qv), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.  Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy _A Fish Called Wanda (1988)_ (qv), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with _The World Is Not Enough (1999)_ (qv), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials.  Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese&apos;s other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with &apos;Connie Booth (I)&apos; (qv) and a daughter with his second wife, &apos;Barbara Trentham&apos; (qv). As of January 19, 2008, he became embroiled in divorce proceedings with third wife (of nineteen years) &apos;Alyce Faye Eichelberger&apos; (qv).  Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.</biography>

      <biography>The oldest of three brothers and three sisters, Paul Warren was born in Hillingdon, Middlesex, England in 1974.  After leaving school with qualifications in drama, art and music, he formed the post-punk rock band &apos;Monkey Boy&apos; with his brother, Mark. A minimalist trio from London, consisting of just two bass players and Paul the singing, front-man drummer, they generated a massive buzz on the underground punk rock scene.  Lockjaw Records signed the band in 1998 and immediately sent them out touring Europe, where they built a formidable following and critical acclaim from the likes of John Peel, Kerrang!, Metal Hammer, Rocksound and Melody Maker.  In 2005, after releasing 2 albums and multiple EP&apos;s, the band went on an indefinite hiatus and Paul set about pursuing work in the film industry.  After a stint of walk-on/featured roles in various films/tv shows, and a body double for Daniel Radcliffe on Harry Potter &amp; the Order of the Phoenix, he was offered work with the legendary Stan Winston Studios on &apos;The Deaths of Ian Stone&apos; which would utilise his thin frame and physical attributes. A door opening into the world of performing in prosthetics, it ultimately led to a film career playing creatures and characters in silicone/foam latex.  Although known mostly now for his performances under heavy prosthetic makeup, he had a regular role on CBBC&apos;s Sorry I&apos;ve Got No Head and was one of the visual fx doubles for skinny Steve Rogers a.k.a Captain America: The First Avenger.  Paul is a highly sort after actor/creature performer, having worked closely with some of the movie industry&apos;s leading visual and makeup effects supervisors, Shane Mahan (Terminator, Aliens), Conor O&apos;Sullivan (The Dark Knight), Christopher Townsend (Industrial Light &amp; Magic), Mark Coulier (Harry Potter), Kristyan Mallett (Dark Shadows) and David White (Thor: The Dark World), on such films as Clash/Wrath of the Titans, World War Z, the upcoming sci-fi thriller Last Days on Mars, and Thor: The Dark World.</biography>

      <biography>A talented character actor known for his military roles, Ronald Lee Ermey was in the United States Marine Corps for 11 years. He rose to the rank of Staff Sergeant, and later was bestowed the honorary rank of Gunnery Sergeant by the Marine Corps, after he served 14 months in Vietnam and later did two tours in Okinawa, Japan. After injuries forced him to retire from the Corps, he moved to the Phillipines, enrolling in the University of Manila, where he studied Criminology and Drama. He appeared in several Filipino films before being cast as a helicopter pilot in &apos;Francis Ford Coppola&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Apocalypse Now (1979)_ (qv). Due to his Vietnam experiences, Coppola also utilized him as a technical adviser. He got a featured role in &apos;Sidney J. Furie&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Boys in Company C (1978)_ (qv), playing a drill instructor. Ermey worked with Furie again in _Purple Hearts (1984)_ (qv).  However, his most famous (or infamous) role came as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in &apos;Stanley Kubrick&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Full Metal Jacket (1987)_ (qv), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe. He did win the best supporting actor award from The Boston Society of Film Critics. Since then, he has appeared in numerous character roles in such films as _Leaving Las Vegas (1995)_ (qv), _Se7en (1995)_ (qv) and _Dead Man Walking (1995)_ (qv). However, Ermey prefers comedy to drama, and has a comedic role in _Saving Silverman (2001)_ (qv). Ronald Lee Ermey continues to be one of the best character actors in the business, and you can bet that when his name appears in a movie&apos;s credits, he is going to be top notch in his role.</biography>

      <biography>Javier Bardem is the youngest member of a family of actors that has been making films since the early days of Spanish cinema. He got his start in the family business, at age six, when he appeared in his first feature, &quot;El picaro&quot; (1974) (A.K.A. The Scoundrel). During his teenage years, he acted in several TV series, played rugby for the Spanish National Team, and toured the country with an independent theatrical group. Javier&apos;s early film role as a sexy stud in the black comedy, _Jamón Jamón (1992)_ (qv) (aka Ham Ham) propelled him to instant popularity and threatened to typecast him as nothing more than a brawny sex symbol. Determined to avert a beefcake image, he refused similar subsequent roles and has gone on to win acclaim for his ability to appear almost unrecognizable from film to film. With over 25 movies and numerous awards under his belt, it is Javier&apos;s stirring, passionate performance as the persecuted Cuban writer, &apos;Reynaldo Arenas (I)&apos; (qv), in _Before Night Falls (2000)_ (qv) that will long be remembered as his breakthrough role. He received five Best Actor awards and a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal.</biography>

His father was an officer at the D-Day landings in Normandy, and after the war he was summoned to Buckingham Palace where he received the Distinguished Service Cross medal from King George VI in person. After graduating from the University of Salford in England with a Bachelors degree, Paul took a trip to California. He liked it so much that he stayed. He applied to be an officer in the U.S Marines and passed all the tests except for the one for his eyesight. Very disappointed, he moved on to other things, including acting. Because of his military look and hair style (high &apos;n&apos; tight) he has been cast in many military roles as a background actor, most recently as a 4-star U.S. Air Force General in a Disney Production. He recently graduated with a Masters degree in Communication from Hawaii Pacific University and can now concentrate on gaining more acting work.</biography>

      <birthName>Caan, Scott Andrew</birthName>
      <biography>Muscular, swaggering and tough, Scott Caan gives every indication of becoming a &quot;man&apos;s-man&quot; like his father, legendary actor &apos;James Caan (I)&apos; (qv). While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv) and &apos;Sean Penn (I)&apos; (qv), Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too.  Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent&apos;s homes. His mom is actress and model &apos;Sheila Ryan (II)&apos; (qv); the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James.  Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father&apos;s hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son&apos;s little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend &apos;The Alchemist&apos; (qv); as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records.  It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, _Aaron Gillespie Will Make You a Star (1995)_ (qv) and _A Boy Called Hate (1995)_ (qv). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including _Bongwater (1997)_ (qv) and &apos;Gregg Araki&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Nowhere (1997)_ (qv).  His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv) for director &apos;Tony Scott (I)&apos; (qv). He then appeared (in the buff) in _Varsity Blues (1999)_ (qv) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a _Boiler Room (2000)_ (qv), _Ready to Rumble (2000)_ (qv), and his second hit picture, _Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000)_ (qv).  Scott&apos;s star rose with a fun supporting turn in &apos;Steven Soderbergh&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films _American Outlaws (2001)_ (qv), _Novocaine (2001)_ (qv), and _Sonny (2002)_ (qv) - &apos;Nicolas Cage&apos; (qv)&apos;s directorial debut starring &apos;James Franco&apos; (qv). Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, _Dallas 362 (2003)_ (qv).  Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller _Into the Blue (2005)_ (qv) and in &apos;Nicole Holofcener&apos; (qv)&apos;s indie comedy, _Friends with Money (2006)_ (qv). 2006 marked Caan&apos;s return to the director¹s chair, with _The Dog Problem (2006)_ (qv), and soon was back for _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on _&quot;Entourage&quot; (2004)_ (qv). Currently, he has a starring role in the remake of the TV series _&quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2010)_ (qv).  Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer &apos;Phil Parmet&apos; (qv). In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.</biography>

      <biography>Marco Flammer was born in Benoni, a city in the greater Johannesburg-area, South Africa on December 12th, 1979. His mother and father, Renate and Eduard Flammer are both German and immigrated in the late 60&apos;s to South Africa from Frankfurt and Tubingen which was then known as the former West Germany. His home language was German while his second and third languages were English, Afrikaans and Xhosa. Originally Marco&apos;s education and vocation was as a civil engineering as a result of his father wishes to have one son to succeed him in the family construction business. He started his tertiary education in 1998 in Pretoria, South Africa at the Tshwane University of Technology and later received a bursary through a university in Groningen in Nederland. He completed his Dutch bachelor&apos;s degree in 2003 in International Civil Engineering Project Management and returned to South Africa to work as a civil engineer in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Secunda and the Eastern Cape while completing a second bachelor&apos;s degree part time in Transportation in 2006. During 2004 and 2006 he also completed a Diploma and started a Degree in Theology with the emphasis on Christian Counselling with the aim to better understand the emotional needs and psychology of other individuals. Marco was determined to work within the arts since a very young age as a result of the influence and inspiration his mother had on him (his mom a gifted artist and teacher). During his childhood his involvement in art was through the media of painting, photography, literature and performing arts in and outside of school hours. He originally dreamed of becoming a graphic designer and fine painting artist to express his creative gift on canvas but never found the time with his demanding career and studies. Soon after the completion of his decorous education in science in 2006 he decided to move to London in March of 2007 in the aim of developing his creative aptitude. At first the grapple to survive and remain in London anchored him firmly to his existing civil engineering vocation and science until he finally reached solidity which allowed him freedom to explore a part time career in acting and photography as a model. His first mini-role was in 2010 when he was cast as a double for Albert Ball (Vincent Regan) in the British film St Georges Day.</biography>

      <biography>Born in Nutley, NJ, Nick Zano&apos;s passion for the movies began when he first watched _Goodfellas (1990)_ (qv) at the age of 12. He had long dreamed of becoming a Navy Seal, but all that changed in one afternoon at the cinema. Shortly after that, Zano and his family moved south to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he finished his high school education. Throughout his high school years, he was active in both the drama and TV production departments. In his junior year, Zano and his closest friends produced a weekly television program at Wellington High School. The wildly humorous and offbeat skit comedy show landed Zano in detention quite often, where he would kill time by writing a series of short films. Those shorts, which he starred in and helped to direct, made their way to the JVC Universal Film Competition semifinals 3 years in a row.  Shortly after high school, he was offered a position with &quot;Prelude Pictures&quot; (_Lost in Space (1998)_ (qv), _Black Dog (1998)_ (qv)) in Television and Feature Film Development. During that time, he also acted as Associate Producer on the World AIDS Day TV special, Living Positive, hosted by &apos;Lou Diamond Phillips&apos; (qv). In June 2001, Zano made the move to LA, where he began the daily grind of auditioning. His quick wit and charming sense of humor immediately made him a favorite among casting directors, who would call him in for reads even when the character description was totally opposite to his looks. Zano has a mental Rolodex overflowing with movie knowledge, which helped him land the hosting gig on MTV&apos;s _&quot;Movie House&quot; (2002)_ (qv), which premiered on the cable channel in May 2002. After his move to LA, Zano remained close with his sisters and his Mom, who always supported and inspired him. Zano resides in Los Angeles.</biography>

      <birthName>Winfrey, Orpah Gail</birthName>
      <biography>Born Orpah Gail Winfrey in Kosciusko, Mississippi, United States. Orpah was born to mother, former maid Vernita Lee, and father, war veteran Vermon Winfrey. Oprah Gail Winfrey was the richest African American of the 20th century, however Orpah Gail Winfrey wasn&apos;t born into a rich, or even middle class family. Orpah Gail Winfrey was born in an economically troubled neighborhood and raised by a single-teenaged mother in the city of Milwaukee. Orpah, named after a biblical character, had a name no one could pronounce, so her family and friends starting calling her Oprah. Shortly after Oprah&apos;s birth, Vernita Lee left her daughter and traveled north. Oprah was then raised by her grandmother,Hatti Mae Lee. Oprah while being raised by her grandmother lived in terrible conditions. Oprah&apos;s only friends were farm animals,however even at that age Oprah had a very imaginative mind. Oprah would frequently give the animals dramatic parts and included them in games. This was perhaps where she had gotten the craze for acting, and would soon be seen in legendary masterpieces such as The Color Purple. Oprah because of her grandmother&apos;s values, had religion and God instilled in herself at a very young age. Oprah because of her grandmother knew how to read,and write before the age of three. Oprah during church would recite poems,and verses from the bible. Soon the church, and the entire neighborhood knew she had a gift and was nicknamed,&quot;The Little Speaker&quot;. This would soon prompt her to become a woman with a strong perspective, which millions across the world would want to have insight on. This prepared her for The Oprah Winfrey Show.  Due to her ability to read and write before the age of three, when enrolled in school she was often promoted several grades ahead of her age. Oprah at the age of six went to live with her mother, Vernita Lee. Vernita worked as a maid, so Oprah was often left alone at home with her cousins. Oprah due to her busy mother was paid little attention to at home, this is what prompted Oprah to started misbehaving and talking back to her mother. Vernita Lee then decided it was best Oprah live with her father in Nashville Tennessee. Oprah while living in Tennessee, found out her mother was pregnant and her mother requested for her to come back to Milwaukee to live with her mother and half-sister.

Oprah wanted to find work outside of Nashville Tennessee and was soon offered a job in Baltimore,Maryland. The job offer came up a few months before her graduation, she had to choose between the job and graduating, so she decided to choose the job in Maryland as the offer was very tempting.

      <biography>Actor Dennis Farina is unique among thespians in that he was one of the few to achieve success as a &quot;late-bloomer.&quot; He did not start acting until he was 37 years old, after stints in the military and 18 years on the Chicago Police Department. He made his bones in show business as a character actor, often cast as a cop or gangster. Though often cast as heavies, Farina was also adept at comedy roles.  A leap year baby born on February 29, 1944 into a Sicilian-American family, Farina&apos;s father Joseph, a physician, was an immigrant from Sicily. After a stint in the service, the Chicago native pinned on a badge and strapped on a gun for the Windy City&apos;s police department from 1967 to 1985. He mostly worked out of the burglary division, which brought him his chance. While he was still a cop in burglary, he was hired as a consultant by director &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv) for the movie _Thief (1981)_ (qv), in which &apos;James Caan (I)&apos; (qv) played a master burglar. Mann cast Farina in a bit part in the movie, which proved to be a small masterpiece. He worked many times with Mann in the future.  Bitten by the acting bug, Farina started acting in Chicago theater before Mann cast him in a lead role in his TV series _&quot;Crime Story&quot; (1986)_ (qv). Even though Farina was two years short of his pension, he quit the Chicago PD to take a chance on acting. He worked steadily in TV and movies ever since.  Farina proved adept at both drama and comedy, as his turn as gangster Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Barboni, &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s rival in _Get Shorty (1995)_ (qv) attested to. In addition to &quot;Crime Story&quot;, he also had a major role on _&quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (1990)_ (qv), essentially replacing &apos;Jerry Orbach&apos; (qv)&apos;s character. His last recurring role on TV was in the 2012 horse racing series _&quot;Luck&quot; (2011)_ (qv).  He was married for 10 years, from 1970 until his divorce in 1980. He and his wife Patricia had three sons; one of them, &apos;Joseph Farina (I)&apos; (qv), became an actor. Dennis Farina died in Scottsdale, Arizona on July 22, 2013 from a blood clot in his lung. He was 69 years old.</biography>

      <biography>Tatiana was born on the 13th of December 1956 in Taganrog, (The Azov Sea), Russia into a family of performers and the home town of Chekhov and F. Ranevskaya. At the age of 18 Tatiana left her homeland to pursue her career as an actress in the big city, MOSCOW. With nothing but Stanislavsky&apos;s words in her mind &apos;Have faith in ALL&apos;. Life had changed and was very far from easy but Tatiana managed to win her place at one of the most credited Moscow Theatrical Academy&apos;s of Performing Arts - RATI obtaining the Red Diploma in Professional Acting for Film, TV and Theatre. She then went on to work in the Moscow Film Industry as well as working in Georgia at the famous Russian-Georgian Culture Drama Theatre - Griboyedov.  Tatiana successfully established her name within the Russian Film Industry, from 1980-1992 completing 5 Feature Films, 10 TV Dramas, 12 Theatre productions (including classical, modern dramas, comedies and musicals), she then went onto write her first film movie script &apos;In The Shadow of Thy Wings Cover Me&apos;, a sensational story of love, loss and misfortune, that had one 1st prize at the international Aids Convention. Ironically came an unexpected betrayal and fall in Tatiana&apos;s career once the script came into production and dramatically changed her working position in Moscow.  This had discouraged Tatiana and had prompted the move London in 1992 to continue her acting career in the UK. More recently Tatiana had appeared in many cameo - character roles in various Film and TV productions in the UK and has worked with the likes of David Cronenberg, Mike Leigh and Otto Bathurst. In between Tatiana has travelled back to Russia to work on the new Alexander Brunkovski film &apos;Unseen Life&apos;, which proved to be a great success.  More recently Tatiana has been featured in Mark Foster&apos;s &apos;World War Z&apos;, playing the part of a Russian Lady alongside Brad Pitt in a very dramatically driven and emotionally evoking episode.</biography>

      <biography>Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, having achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He has won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, three as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his &quot;10,000 Year Old Man&quot; album, based on his comedy routine with &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv).  Reiner was born in The Bronx. His father Irving, a Romanian immigrant, was a watchmaker; his mother, Bessie (née Mathias), had been born in Austria. At the age of 16, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.  In the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in _New Faces of 1937 (1937)_ (qv), but that is unlikely as he would have only been 15-years-old at the time. (Interesting, that movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; 1968 classic, _The Producers (1967)_ (qv), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his &quot;angels&quot; by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn&apos;t appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his TV debut in 1948 in the short-lived TV series, _&quot;The Fashion Story&quot; (1948)_ (qv), then became a regular, the following year, on _&quot;The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue&quot; (1949), another TV series with a brief life.  Reiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical &quot;Inside U.S.A.&quot;, a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the 1950 musical revue, &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. &apos;Max Liebman&apos; (qv), the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show&apos;s troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn&apos;t help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.  Leibman was a producer-director on _&quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; (1950)_ (qv), one of the great TV series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner&apos;s first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing &quot;The Professor&quot;, a character played by &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv). He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in _&quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot; (1954)_ (qv). (&apos;Imogene Coca&apos; (qv) was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produced specials).  &quot;Your Show or Shows&quot; had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young &apos;Bob Fosse&apos; (qv)) whereas &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot; was pure comedy. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, &apos;Howard Morris (I)&apos; (qv), and &apos;Nanette Fabray&apos; (qv) (who went on to win an Emmy) moved over to &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. In addition to &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv), the writing staff included &apos;Neil Simon (I)&apos; (qv), his brother &apos;Danny Simon (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Larry Gelbart&apos; (qv) and &apos;Mel Tolkin&apos; (qv). (There are rumors that the young &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv) served as the writing staff&apos;s typist).  Reiner had sat in informally with the writers during &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, but he began writing formally for &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;, having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited &quot;writer without portfolio&quot;, he was able to leave writers&apos; meetings at 6 PM, if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.  In 1959, he created the pilot for a TV series, &quot;Man of the House&quot;, in which he would play a writer, &quot;Rob Petrie&quot;, who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv) (a &quot;benign despot&quot; who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Caesar&apos;s Hour&quot;. The network didn&apos;t pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner&apos;s part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with &apos;Mel Brooks (I)&apos; (qv) on _&quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; (1956)_ (qv), and their routine &quot;The 2000 Year Old Man&quot; was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated TV special based on their shtick in 1975.  Though CBS turned down &quot;Man of the House&quot;, with the two-time Emmy-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a WASP in the role of &quot;Rob Petrie&quot; to ensure the broad appeal of the show, and the casting of the protagonist came down to &apos;Johnny Carson (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Dick Van Dyke&apos; (qv). Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical, _Bye Bye Birdie (1963)_ (qv), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the part and another chapter of TV history was made, when &apos;Mary Tyler Moore&apos; (qv), &apos;Rose Marie (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Morey Amsterdam&apos; (qv) all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of &quot;Alan Brady&quot;, the abrasive &apos;Sid Caesar&apos; (qv)-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series&apos; five-year run.  Another milestone in TV comedy, _&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961)_ (qv), brought Reiner five more Emmies, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer &apos;Sheldon Leonard&apos; (qv) and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmies as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of &quot;Alan Brady&quot; on _&quot;Mad About You&quot; (1992)_ (qv), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.  It was on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play &apos;Joseph Stein&apos; (qv) had adapted from his 1958 novel, _Enter Laughing (1967)_ (qv). His work as a writer-director, with &apos;Dick Van Dyke&apos; (qv), in creating a &apos;Stan Laurel&apos; (qv)-type character in _The Comic (1969)_ (qv) was not a success, but _Where&apos;s Poppa? (1970)_ (qv) became a cult classic and _Oh, God! (1977)_ (qv), with &apos;George Burns (I)&apos; (qv), and _The Jerk (1979)_ (qv), with &apos;Steve Martin (I)&apos; (qv), were smash hits. The last movie he directed was the 1997 comedy, _That Old Feeling (1997)_ (qv).  Reiner&apos;s career has continued on into the 21st Century, when most of his contemporaries had retired. He was awarded the &apos;Mark Twain&apos; (qv) Prize for American Humor in 2000 and, starting in 2001, he acted in the remake of _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv) and its two sequels. Most recently, he has appeared as a voice artist in the animated series, _&quot;The Cleveland Show&quot; (2009)_ (qv) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; experience) and has appeared as a regular on the TV series, _&quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; (2010)_ (qv) (with fellow nonagenarian &apos;Betty White (I)&apos; (qv)), as well as appeared on an episode of _&quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2009)_ (qv) in 2012.</biography>

She studied drama and music and, at 17, was discovered by a Swedish film director who cast her in the movie _Ingen kan älska som vi (1988)_ (qv), which made her a local teenage idol. She then became a successful model in Sweden and throughout Europe, where she made good use of her fluency in four languages.  In 1989, Scorupco displayed another facet of her talents, launching her career as a pop singer with her first single, Substitute. The single and subsequent album, IZA, both went gold, and she followed with another hit single, Shame, Shame, which she recorded in 1991. Returning to acting in 1994, she immediately won the lead role in the Swedish film _Petri tårar (1995)_ (qv). Scorupco stars as a woman who lives her life as a man in the medieval drama, which was released in August 1995.</biography>

      <birthName>Broccoli, Barbara Dana</birthName>
      <biography>She is one of the entertainment industry&apos;s most successful female producers. Barbara Broccoli was born to legendary filmmaker &apos;Albert R. Broccoli&apos; (qv), affectionately known as Cubby, and &apos;Dana Broccoli&apos; (qv) on June 18, 1960. Not long after, Cubby Broccoli and his new partner, &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv), secured studio backing for an ambitious series of films inspired by the popular James Bond novels written by &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv).  Ms. Broccoli grew up in the behind-the-scenes world of James Bond, traveling with her family around the world to various exotic locations. As a child, she liked to play with the photocopy machines in the offices of Eon Productions, Ltd., her father&apos;s company responsible for the Bond films. During location shooting in Japan for _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), young Barbara caught a fever from the Japanese custom of sleeping on the floor. &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv), whose star status provided him with a comfortable bed, generously relinquished it so Barbara could properly fight her illness.  She graduated from Loyola University in Los Angeles, California with a degree in motion picture and television communications. Her first official credited job on the Bond films was for 1983&apos;s _Octopussy (1983)_ (qv) in which she served as an executive assistant. But, as with any family business, one helps out where one can. For instance, in her father&apos;s autobiography &quot;When The Snow Melts&quot;, she recalls a nightmarish situation involving _A View to a Kill (1985)_ (qv) star &apos;Grace Jones (I)&apos; (qv). Later, for the two &apos;Timothy Dalton&apos; (qv) Bond films, she was promoted to associate producer, a post she shared with veteran Bond associate producer &apos;Tom Pevsner&apos; (qv).  The August 8, 1990 issue of Variety (weekly) reported that aging Cubby Broccoli had turned control of Eon Productions Ltd. over to Barbara and her half-brother, &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) (Dana&apos;s son, who had been an invaluable help to Cubby and the Bond franchise in various capacities since the mid-1970s). Due to some unfortunate business dealings with then-MGM ownership (the studio that bankrolled Bond and held significant interest in the series), production of the Bond films was put on what would become a six year hiatus.  When the litigation was settled, &quot;Bond 17&quot; (eventually named _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) was on track and Barbara Broccoli, now a full producer alongside &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv), was faced with the challenge of bringing Bond back to the big screen. She has earned a reputation as being tough when she has to be and for volunteering for the toughest jobs, such as overseeing the Russian location unit. _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv) was a world-wide smash, and each of the succeeding Bond films were also enormously popular. This is a testament to the talent of Cubby Broccoli, who passed his knowledge of high-stakes film production on to Michael and later Barbara. The benefit of Cubby&apos;s experience is obvious when viewing the newest Bond films starring &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv).  Her non-Bond producing credits include _Crime of the Century (1996) (TV)_ (qv), which deals with the murder trial from the famous Lindberg kidnapping, and the popular London Stage production of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, which was co-produced by her mother &apos;Dana Broccoli&apos; (qv) and half-brother &apos;Michael G. Wilson.&apos; Both productions carried a personal interest for Ms. Broccoli. Charles Lindberg was her father&apos;s favorite hero, and &quot;Chitty&quot; was adapted from the film produced by her father, which was based upon the children&apos;s novel by &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Kurylenko, Olga Konstantinovna</birthName>
      <biography>Olga Kurylenko, a Ukrainian-born actress and model, went from sharing a cramped flat with her aunt, uncle, grandparents and cousin to starring as a Bond girl opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv).  She was born Olga Konstantinovna Kurylenko on November 14, 1979, in Berdyansk, Ukraine, Soviet Union. Her mother, Marina Alyabysheva, divorced her father, Konstantin Kurylenko, soon after her birth. After the divorce her mother struggled to survive as an art teacher. Young Olga was brought up by her mother and her grandmother, Raisa. During her youth Olga had the humbling experience of living in poverty; she had no choice but to wear rags and had to darn the holes on her sweater. During her years in Ukraine she studied art and languages and spent seven years studying piano at a local school of music in Berdyansk. She also went to a ballet studio until 13.  At age 13 Olga and her mother made a trip to Moscow. There she was spotted by an agent, who approached her at a subway station and offered her a job as a model. Initially Olga&apos;s mother was suspicious, but she checked the agent&apos;s credentials and eventually allowed Olga to accept training as a model in Moscow, which turned out to be a good career choice.  By age 16 she was ready for the next step. She moved to Paris, learned French in six months and was signed by the Madison agency. At age 18 she appeared on the cover of Glamour, and in short order graced the covers of Elle, Madame Figaro, Marie Claire, and Vogue. She also became the face of Lejaby lingerie, Bebe clothing, Clarins and Helena Rubinstein cosmetic companies.  In 1999 Olga married French photographer &apos;Cedric Van Mol&apos; (qv), but divorced him 3-1/2 years later. One day Olga presented herself to an acting agency. Eventually she swapped the catwalk for the movie screen, and her acting career took off. In 2005 she made her film debut as &quot;Iris&quot;, a sensual beauty, in _L&apos;annulaire (2005)_ (qv), by director &apos;Diane Bertrand&apos; (qv).  Olga&apos;s cinematic roles have been notably steamy, and her natural beauty and explicit nudity attracted the attention of the male audiences. She appeared opposite &apos;Elijah Wood&apos; (qv) in _Paris, je t&apos;aime (2006)_ (qv) and as &quot;Sofia&quot; in _Le serpent (2006)_ (qv), then co-starred as Russian beauty &quot;Nika Boronina&quot; opposite &apos;Timothy Olyphant (I)&apos; (qv) in _Hitman (2007/I)_ (qv). She also appeared as &quot;Mina Harud&quot; in the indie surveillance-thriller _&quot;Tyranny&quot; (2008)_ (qv). On Christmas Eve 2007, Olga was offered to play what will become her biggest hit: co-starring as &quot;Camille&quot;, the Bond girl, opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv) in _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv), a sequel to _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv).  With the international success as Bond Girl, Olga also made appearances on various TV productions in Russia and Ukraine. In 2012, Olga Kurylenko was cast as Julia, supporting role in the Sci-Fi adventure _Oblivion (2013/I)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Tom Cruse&apos; (qv) and &apos;Morgan Freeman (I)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Broccoli, Albert Romolo</birthName>
      <biography>Albert Romolo Broccoli was born in Astoria, Queens (New York City) on April 5th, 1909. His mother and father, Cristina and Giovanni Broccoli, raised young Albert in New York on the family farm. The family was in the vegetable business, and Albert claimed one of his uncles brought the first broccoli seeds into the United States in the 1870&apos;s. Albert&apos;s cousin &apos;Pat DiCicco&apos; (qv) gave him the nickname &quot;Cubby&quot; after a comic strip character named Kabibble. Cubby worked in a pharmacy and then as a coffin-maker, but a trip to see his cousin in Los Angeles gave him an ambition for film stardom. Pat was an actor&apos;s agent, and introduced Cubby to such stars as &apos;Randolph Scott (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Cary Grant (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Bob Hope (I)&apos; (qv).  In 1940, at the age of 31, Cubby married actress &apos;Gloria Blondell&apos; (qv). That same year the head of 20th Century-Fox offered him an assistant director position on _The Outlaw (1943)_ (qv), directed by &apos;Howard Hawks&apos; (qv) and produced by his good friend &apos;Howard Hughes (I)&apos; (qv). After this initial job opportunity Cubby became the top assistant director at Fox. He went on to serve as A.D. on such films as _The Song of Bernadette (1943)_ (qv) and _The Black Swan (1942)_ (qv). When World War II began, Cubby joined the U.S. Navy, where he met future film producer &apos;Ray Stark&apos; (qv), and together they become heads of entertainment for the troops. Cubby and Gloria decided to end their marriage in 1945, but remained good friends. After the war Cubby determined to get back into the movie business.  In 1946 his cousin Pat worked out the financing for a project called _Avalanche (1946)_ (qv), on which Cubby served as production manager. The film spawned a partnership between Cubby and director &apos;Irving Allen&apos; (qv). Broccoli and Allen later formed Warwick Productions, which eventually became a very successful independent production company based in London, England. After the poor response to &quot;Avalanche&quot;, however, Broccoli worked various odd jobs, including selling Christmas trees in California, and eventually took a job as a talent agent, where he represented, among others, &apos;Robert Wagner (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Lana Turner&apos; (qv).  In 1951 Cubby married Nedra Clark. That same year he left the talent agency and, together with his partner Allen, reformed Warwick to make _The Red Beret (1953)_ (qv). The film, released in the US as &quot;Paratrooper&quot;, was very profitable. Broccoli and Allen become the most successful independent producers in England, turning out such hits as _Safari (1956)_ (qv), _Zarak (1956)_ (qv) and _The Bandit of Zhobe (1959)_ (qv). Cubby and Nedra wanted to start a family but, according to the doctor, Nedra was unable to become pregnant. They instead adopted a young baby boy named Tony. Shortly afterwards Nedra became pregnant after all, and gave birth to a girl, whom they named Tina. Unfortunately, Nedra died in New York shortly afterwards. Cubby was now a widower with two children to raise. He spent months trying to get new film projects off the ground and support his family.  Cubby met &apos;Dana Wilson (I)&apos; (qv) at a New Year&apos;s Eve party and there was an instant attraction. The two fell in love and, after five weeks, Cubby proposed marriage. Dana flew to London and started a new life with Cubby. However, things were about to turn sour for him. After making _The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960)_ (qv), which was financed out of his and Allen&apos;s own pockets, the two went bankrupt due to the poor box-office returns because of adverse reaction to the subject matter--&apos;Oscar Wilde&apos; (qv)&apos;s homosexuality. The film wasn&apos;t allowed to be advertised in the US and never made back its production costs during initial release. Cubby and Allen ended their partnership after the failure of the film. On June 18, 1960, Dana gave birth to a baby girl, &apos;Barbara Broccoli&apos; (qv). One night Dana asked Cubby if there was something he really wanted to do. Cubby replied. &quot;I always wanted to film the &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) James Bond books.&quot;  Cubby then managed to meet with &apos;Harry Saltzman&apos; (qv), the man who held the option to the books. Together they formed Eon Productions Ltd. and Danjaq S.A. to make the first James Bond film, _Dr. No (1962)_ (qv). However, they needed financing. The two men flew to New York and met with &apos;Arthur Krim&apos; (qv), the head of United Artists. Within the hour Broccoli and Saltzman had a deal to make the first 007 film adventure. Despite the small budget of $1 million, the producers insisted on filming on location in Jamaica and using the then virtually unknown &apos;Sean Connery&apos; (qv) in the title role. Bond became the most successful film series in history and made Cubby Broccoli a household name.  Together with Saltzman, Broccoli produced _From Russia with Love (1963)_ (qv), _Goldfinger (1964)_ (qv), _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), _You Only Live Twice (1967)_ (qv), _On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service (1969)_ (qv), _Diamonds Are Forever (1971)_ (qv), _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv) and _The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)_ (qv). After nine years as partners, Saltzman sold his share of Eon/Danjaq to United Artists and Cubby became the sole producer of the James Bond films. He later brought in his stepson, &apos;Michael G. Wilson (I)&apos; (qv), and his daughter Barbara, making it a true family affair. Broccoli&apos;s last non-Bond film was _Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)_ (qv). He had purchased the rights to this &apos;Ian Fleming (I)&apos; (qv) story when he got the 007 book option. They brought in songwriters &apos;Richard M. Sherman&apos; (qv) and &apos;Robert B. Sherman&apos; (qv), who were under contract to Disney, to write the music for this musical.  In 1982 Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Award for his long and successful producing career. The award was presented by &apos;Roger Moore (I)&apos; (qv) at the Academy Awards ceremony. Broccoli stated that it was one of the happiest days of his life and was very pleased to have received such a great honor. He stopped during his speech to thank all of the hundreds of crew technicians and actors who have helped make his films possible. In 1990 he was honored by having his star placed on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and was even honored by the Queen of England for his contribution to cinema and the British community. Broccoli&apos;s last film was _Licence to Kill (1989)_ (qv). He had heart problems throughout the early 1990s and was unable to go to the set of _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv).  Cubby&apos;s last years were spent at his home in Beverly Hills, surrounded by his children and grandchildren. Despite awards, honors and an amazing film career, the most important thing in his life was his family. After undergoing a triple-bypass in 1995, Cubby Broccoli passed away on Thursday, June 27, 1996, surrounded by loved ones. He was 87 and was one of the best-loved and most respected producers in Hollywood. No one ever had anything bad to say about Cubby and, according to many, he was a gentleman who cared about every one of his cast and crew and was the last true film producer. Albert R. &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli&apos;s legacy lives on thanks to his family, which carries on the tradition of making the James Bond films.</biography>

      <birthName>Zahn, James Charles</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Chicago Heights, Illinois in the late 1970s, James spent much of his youth growing up in the South Suburbs of Chicago. Obsessed with pop-culture in its many forms, he spent much of his time drawing, writing, and focusing on becoming a performer of some sort.  In 1987 his original short story &quot;The Little Champ&quot; became an Illinois Young Author Award winner, and the seeds for a career as a writer were planted. Less than two years later, the budding filmmaker would also emerge.  Having grown up in front of a camera, with his childhood exploits captured by his parents on Super 8mm home movies, James shot his first short film &quot;Art Attack&quot; using the very same camera in early 1989. The film made its debut for classmates at his school.  By the time high school rolled around, all of James&apos; interests were actively being pursued. After moving to Davenport, Iowa in the spring of 1992, he began work on a cable-access program that was quite ambitious for a 15-year old. &quot;ZTV&quot; made its debut in the summer of 1992 and became a cult hit in Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois. Practically overnight, the show was featured in the local news-media, and attracted musical guests such as Faith No More, Megadeth, Stone Temple Pilots, and more. In the spring of 1994, after 40 Episodes, &quot;ZTV&quot; came to an end with a 30 minute special featuring the band &quot;White Zombie&quot;.  At the same time &quot;ZTV&quot; was on the air, James was also actively writing and taking photographs for three regional arts magazines. His published work would include interviews with artists such as Pantera, Dr. John, and Genitorturers, and led him to be a photographer at Lollapalooza &apos;93.  The mid 90s was a time of experimentation on the musical front. Zahn was soon fronting the rock band &quot;Odlid!&quot;, performing guitar and vocals. The band appeared on numerous compilation CDs, and recorded one-full length album, before breaking-up in early 1998. In addition, they performed at famed venues such as Gabe&apos;s Oasis (Iowa City), RIBCO (Rock Island, IL), and Chicago&apos;s historic Riviera Theatre, sharing the stage with acts such as Demolition Dollrods, Johnny Socko, and more.  In 2000, James returned to music with a series of unreleased demos, followed by one Internet cult favorite (Darth Vader is A Real Cool Guy), and a track for Artisan Entertainment&apos;s &quot;Blair Witchmix&quot;, an on-line soundtrack to promote the ill-fated &quot;Blair Witch 2&quot;. His track, &quot;Burkittsville&quot; was featured along 12 other tracks, by artists such as Jane&apos;s Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins, and Marilyn Manson, being performed as a part of the _Blair Witch WebFest (2000)_ (qv) .  In 2001, James returned to film, where he has been ever since, and intends to stay. He and his wife soon founded FMFE as an outlet for his creative endeavors. Since that time, James has directed numerous short films, music videos,industrials, and much more. In addition, acting had become a main passion.  Keeping the music going as well, James entered Kenosha, Wisconsin&apos;s Renwood Messenger Studios in February of 2004 to begin work on a concept project called &quot;Saturday Action Theatre&quot;, producing four acoustic tracks from those sessions. In July, he entered Bombshelter Studios in Chicago, with Producer Dan Precision (Break The Silence, Rise Against) and cut 3 electric tracks, completing what would become the &quot;Remakes and Sequels EP&quot;. The disc hit stores on August 17, 2004.  Forging ahead into a bigger filmic realm, James began work on the screenplay for &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; in late 2004. Completed in February 2005, the multi-genre epic spent several years in &quot;development hell&quot;, all while gaining a global fanbase. Nominated for a SpikeTV &quot;Scream Award&quot; for &quot;Most Anticipated Film&quot; in 2007 (while still in-development), the project would find new life in January 2008.  After moving forward under the control of Zahn and his writing partner &apos;Ben Brezinski&apos; (qv), &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; was back in-development as an independent film along with it&apos;s already-written sequel &quot;The Long December.&quot; On June 26th, 2008 Issue #0 of the comic book prequel series also called &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; made it&apos;s public debut at Wizard World Chicago, largely regarded as the 2nd Largest Pop-Culture Event in North America. The book quickly gained acceptance by readers and critics alike as positive reviews began appearing online. Issue #0 was published by The Scream Factory, and was called a &quot;must-have&quot; by Comics Buyer&apos;s Guide. In October 2008 it was announced that the &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; comic books would being published by Fangoria Graphix, the relaunched comic arm of Fangoria Magazine. After publishing only one new issue of the series and a reissue of #0, Fangoria Graphix went out of business due to continued restructuring of the parent company. The books then returned to The Scream Factory for future publication.  In addition, James continued working steadily as an actor, appearing in projects for Warner Bros., Twentieth Century Fox, and Sony Pictures. He recently appeared in the feature film _Lonely Joe (2009)_ (qv) in a supporting role alongside &apos;Erica Leerhsen&apos; (qv) of _Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (2007) (V)_ (qv) fame, and voiced several famous &quot;Transformers&quot; characters for a sketch on G4TV&apos;s &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;. In November of 2008, Zahn began appearing in television commercials for Wendy&apos;s, an American chain of fast-food restaurants. Around the same time, he appeared in an &quot;Alcohol Sales Training&quot; video for Walgreens stores.  In August of 2010, Zahn announced via Twitter that he would be taking a break from acting to focus on personal projects, including his work with Kik Axe Music. A November article with Reel Chicago revealed that not only would The Scream Factory be publishing more &quot;Death Walks the Streets&quot; books, but that a film set in the DWTS world would be in development once more at some point in the near future.  2011 saw a return to filmmaking via music videos and short films. A concept short film was created for the band Product of Hate and their song entitled &quot;Unholy Manipulator.&quot; Filmed over three days in and around Crestline, Ohio, _Hellraiser (1987)_ (qv) actress &apos;Ashley Laurence&apos; (qv) stars as the title character. With production and special FX provided by &apos;Robert Kurtzman&apos; (qv) , a mid-2012 release date is expected.  In 2012, Zahn revealed that he would be leaving his writing and editing duties at Kik Axe Music behind in order to focus on his personal site, The Rock Father. A family-friendly destination geared toward &quot;music-loving caregivers and kids,&quot; the site was expanded from a hosted blog to a standalone full-service site on February 1, 2012.  Additionally, music-centric filmmaking has continued, as Zahn directed and edited the Product of Hate music video &quot;Blood Coated Concrete&quot; (released Feb 7, 2012), the Dirge Within lyric video &quot;For My Enemies&quot; (released March 7, 2012), and the album trailer for &quot;The Industrialist,&quot; the eighth studio album from the band &apos;Fear Factory&apos; (qv) .</biography>

      <biography>By age 22, Nathan Roberson had already acquired a resume that most people only dream about. As a child , Nathan practically grew up on the soundstages of Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida. His handsome profile and natural &quot;boyish&quot; charms made him a commodity for the production team at Nickelodeon. However, his parents made sure his schooling always came first. After college, Nathan made the beautiful Los Angeles suburb of Toluca Lake, California his primary home, but still makes frequent trips back and forth to Orlando. In early 2000, Nathan was cast in a teen talk show consisting of five principle hosts. He was shocked to learn soon after, that the pilot and potential series would be shot and produced in his hometown of Orlando! Unfortunately, the show wasn&apos;t picked up that season, but one of the show&apos;s producers approached Nathan the last day of shooting and expressed an interest in using him for several other projects in the near future. From that day on, Nathan has remained very busy with a lot of television commercials and music videos. In the rare event of any spare time, Nathan enjoys an active social life in both Los Angeles and Orlando and is very grateful for all the support he receives from his family and his fans.</biography>

      <biography>Nicholas - or Nick - Woodeson, born in 1949 in England to British parents - spent his early childhood in Haifa in Israel in line with his parents&apos; diplomatic postings and recalls that his first taste of thespian glory was reciting A. A. Milne poems to family friends at the age of six. Nick&apos;s strong affinity and regard for the Middle East has meant that, in the 2000s, he has written several heart-felt letters to English broadsheet newspapers expressing his views on the Middle East crisis and American involvement therein. Sent back to England to complete a boarding school education, he went on to Sussex University where his interest in drama re-surfaced and he engaged in competitive productions for the British National Student Drama Festival. As a consequence he was noticed by , and obtained his first acting job for, the theatrical repertory company at Crewe in Cheshire, England, ruefully noting in hindsight that he was usually a prompter or assistant stage manager, rather than a player. However, he soon obtained a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, and later joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, in 1981, remaining with them intermittently until 1990. He has consequently appeared in other media including films like &apos;Topsy-Turvy&apos; and television dramas like &apos;Midsomer Murders&apos; in 1998, where he played one of several murder suspects, along with actress Angela Pleasence. A year later, Angela and Nick played a mother and son in the stage play &apos;The Late Middle Classes&apos;,notwithstanding the fact that, with no more than a decade&apos;s age gap between them. From 2007, he reached a global audience as Julius Caesar&apos;s clever and loyal &quot;body slave&quot; Posca, in the BBC/HBO TV blockbuster, &apos;Rome&apos;.</biography>

      <birthName>Damon, Matthew Paige</birthName>
      <biography>Matthew Paige Damon, or better known to fans as Matt Damon was born in Boston Massachusetts, USA to &apos;Kent Damon&apos; (qv), a stockbroker, Realtor and tax preparer, and &apos;Nancy Carlsson-Paige&apos; (qv), an early childhood education professor at Lesley University. Matt has an older brother named Kyle who is now a sculptor. Unfortunately for Matt and his brother, their parents divorced in the year 1973.  The 5&apos;10&quot; star is of English, Scottish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. While his parents were still together, their family lived in Newton, before eventually settling for a divorce, where Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community back in Massachusetts. Matt also grew up near actor &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv), when he was younger.  Matt attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School which is located in Cambridge and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. Later on, he was accepted into Harvard University as an English major in the fall of 1988 and was supposed to graduate with the class of 1992. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, _Rising Sun (1993)_ (qv), and prep-school drama, _School Ties (1992)_ (qv). It was until his film, _Geronimo: An American Legend (1993)_ (qv), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely.  Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, _Mystic Pizza (1988)_ (qv). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in _School Ties (1992)_ (qv).  Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, _Courage Under Fire (1996)_ (qv). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems. The following year, he garnered accolades for _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. _Good Will Hunting (1997)_ (qv) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv).  In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv)&apos;s film, _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year. Matt had the opportunity of working with &apos;Tom Hanks&apos; (qv) and &apos;Vin Diesel&apos; (qv) while filming that movie. That same year, he starred as an earnest law student and reformed poker player in _Rounders (1998)_ (qv), starring opposite &apos;Edward Norton (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;John Malkovich&apos; (qv).  The next year, Matt rejoined his childhood friend, &apos;Ben Affleck&apos; (qv) and fellow comedian, &apos;Chris Rock (I)&apos; (qv), in the comedy _Dogma (1999)_ (qv). Towards the end of 1999, Matt played &quot;Tom Ripley&quot;, a working-class young man who tastes the good life and will do anything to live it. Both &apos;Jude Law&apos; (qv) and &apos;Gwyneth Paltrow&apos; (qv) also starred in the movie. _The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)_ (qv) earned mixed reviews from critics, but even so, Matt earned praise for his performance.  Matt lent his voice to the animated movie, _Titan A.E. (2000)_ (qv) in the year 2000, which also earned mixed reviews from the public. He also starred in two other movies, _All the Pretty Horses (2000)_ (qv) and the golf comedy-drama, _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), starring alongside &apos;Will Smith (I)&apos; (qv).  In the year 2003, he signed on to star in _The Informant! (2009)_ (qv) by &apos;Steven Soderbergh&apos; (qv) and the Farrelly Brothers&apos; _Stuck on You (2003)_ (qv). He also starred in _Gerry (2002)_ (qv), a film he co-wrote with his friends, &apos;Gus Van Sant&apos; (qv) and &apos;Casey Affleck&apos; (qv).  One of Matt&apos;s most recognizable work to date is his role in the &quot;Bourne&quot; movie franchise. He plays an amnesiac assassin, &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, in _The Bourne Identity (2002)_ (qv), _The Bourne Supremacy (2004)_ (qv) and _The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)_ (qv).  Another praised role is that as &quot;Linus Caldwell&quot; in the &quot;Ocean&apos;s&quot; movie franchise. He had the opportunity to star opposite &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv), &apos;Brad Pitt&apos; (qv), &apos;Julia Roberts (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Don Cheadle&apos; (qv) in _Ocean&apos;s Eleven (2001)_ (qv). The successful crime comedy-drama eventually had two other sequels, _Ocean&apos;s Twelve (2004)_ (qv) and _Ocean&apos;s Thirteen (2007)_ (qv).  Among other highly acclaimed movies that Matt managed to be a part of was in &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Brothers Grimm (2005)_ (qv), &apos;George Clooney&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Syriana (2005)_ (qv), &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Departed (2006)_ (qv) and &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv)&apos;s _The Good Shepherd (2006)_ (qv).  In his personal life, Matt is now happily married to Argentine-born &apos;Luciana Barroso&apos; (qv), whom he met in Miami, where she was working as a bartender. They married in a private civil ceremony on December 9, 2005, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. The couple have four daughters Alexia, Luciana&apos;s daughter from a previous relationship, as well as Isabella, Gia and Stella.

      <birthName>Lewis, Lennox Claudius</birthName>
      <biography>After a long amateur career that included a gold medal winning performance in the 1988 Seoul Olympics that came in the form of a KO of &apos;Riddick Bowe&apos; (who also went on to win the world heavyweight crown), former undisputed world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis turned professional in 1989. His 2 round win over Canadian boxer Donnovan Ruddock in Oct of 1992 gained him recognition as a threat among the tough heavyweight ranks. Lewis, a citizen of England and Canada, was slated for a shot at the winner of &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) vs Riddick Bowe. Bowe, a victim of a brutal knockout suffered at the hands of Lewis in the amateur ranks, refused to live up to his end of the bargain by not giving Lewis a well-deserved title shot and infamously tossed the WBC title in a garbage bin. This act prompted the WBC commission to strip Bowe and crown Lewis as the new WBC champion. Lennox Lewis went on to defend the crown for several fights until he was defeated by Oliver McCall in 2 rounds in Sept of 1994. Lewis, with the help of new trainer &apos;Emanuel Steward&apos; (qv), came back and began tearing his way through the ranks of the heavyweight division. Lewis was again denied a title shot when champion &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv) relinquished his WBC title to fight &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) rather than risk his titles against Lewis. Lewis recaptured the vacant WBC title by beating his conquerer Oliver McCall in a rematch. Lewis, after defeating every top contender thrown his way, was given his shot at &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) in a championship unification fight on March 13, 1999. Lewis dominated the fight but due to controversial judging, the bout was declared a draw. Lewis defeated &apos;Evander Holyfield&apos; (qv) in a rematch on Nov 13, 1999 to become undisputed world champion. Due to promoter &apos;Don King (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s underhanded tactics, the WBA belt was stripped from Lewis in court. Lewis went on to beat every mandatory challenger while keeping his crown. While avidly issuing challenges to reluctant contender &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv), Lewis went to Johannesburg in South Africa at the invitation of &apos;Nelson Mandela&apos; (qv). Lewis would defend his titles against supposed low-risk opponent Hasim Rahman. Due to Lewis&apos; failure to prepare for the fight by dropping excessive weight rapidly, arriving in Johannesburg 2 weeks before the fight which, according to expert opinion, was too late to acclimatize to the thin air since Johannesburg was 5,000 feet above sea level, Lewis suffered one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. However, Lewis has had his rematch with Hashim Rahman and won the title back, and he also fought &apos;Mike Tyson (I)&apos; (qv) and beaten him &apos;easily&apos; in 8 rounds.</biography>

      <biography>John C. McGinley&apos;s path to stardom is a story that reads like a classic Hollywood script. While an understudy in New York in the Circle-In-The-Square production of John Patrick Shanley&apos;s &quot;Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,&quot; he was spotted by director Oliver Stone and soon after was cast in &quot;Platoon,&quot; the first of a long list of collaborations between Stone and McGinley which includes &quot;Wall Street,&quot; &quot;Talk Radio,&quot; &quot;Born on the Fourth of July,&quot; &quot;Nixon&quot; and &quot;Any Given Sunday.&quot;  He has received rave reviews for his work in NBC&apos;s Emmy-nominated medical comedy series, &quot;Scrubs&quot; - now in production on its seventh and final season. TV Guide proclaimed, &quot;The young cast is appealing, but McGinley steals the show as the mercurial doctor who deep down actually gives a damn. So will you.&quot; And the San Francisco Chronicle glowed, &quot;If [McGinley] doesn&apos;t win the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy, I&apos;m going to bring the smack-down to the Emmy voters.&quot;  John C. relishes the chance to portray the gruff, worldly &apos;Dr. Perry Cox&apos; on &quot;Scrubs.&quot; &quot;As an actor, it&apos;s great to play a strong leader with a heart of gold,&quot; he offers. &quot;Dr. Cox mentors the rookie doctors with a spoonful of dirt and then a cup of sugar. I see him as an archetypal descendant of two of my favorite curmudgeonly characters: Lou Grant and Louie De Palma.&quot;  Most recently, John C. starred opposite Ice Cube in Sony/Revolution Studios&apos; feature, &quot;Are We Done Yet?,&quot; the sequel to the hit comedy &quot;Are We There Yet?.&quot; &quot;Are We Done Yet?&quot; picks up as the family moves from the big city to the suburbs for an idyllic life. A house renovation leads to chaos, particularly when the enthusiastic and larger-than-life real estate agent/neighbor/contractor &apos;Chuck Mitchell, Jr.&apos; (John C. McGinley) who is hired to work on the home, clashes with Ice Cube&apos;s character but bonds with his wife and kids. Of John C.&apos;s performance, The New York Times proclaimed, &quot;....a marvelous John C. McGinley, playing a dodgy jack-of-all-trades with the kind of energy that forces other actors to step up their game. He is so good. He redeems his character through acting skill alone.&quot;  John C. voiced the main character in &quot;Dead Head Fred,&quot; an original PSP (PlayStation) game featuring dark humor and a violent portrayal of revenge and redemption. John C. will bring to life &apos;Fred Neuman,&apos; a private detective savagely murdered and then resurrected in a bizarre scientific experiment without his memory or his head.  John C.&apos;s impressive career in film spans a diverse range of characters in over sixty features to date. He has also appeared in such features as &quot;Wild Hogs,&quot; &quot;Identity,&quot; &quot;The Animal,&quot; &quot;The Rock,&quot; &quot;Nothing to Lose,&quot; &quot;Set It Off,&quot; &quot;Seven,&quot; &quot;Office Space,&quot; &quot;Mother,&quot; &quot;Wagons East,&quot; &quot;Surviving the Game,&quot; &quot;On Deadly Ground,&quot; &quot;Point Break,&quot; &quot;Highlander II,&quot; &quot;A Midnight Clear&quot; and &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy.&quot;  John C. has a solid commitment to the independent film community as well as the studio system. He appeared in director Eriq La Salle&apos;s &quot;Crazy As Hell&quot; and director Scott Silver&apos;s &quot;Johns.&quot; He also worked on &quot;Truth or Consequences, N.M.,&quot; Kiefer Sutherland&apos;s feature directorial debut; and on &quot;Colin Fitz,&quot; a film John C. co-produced which premiered in competition at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. He recently starred in director D.B. Sweeney&apos;s independent feature, &quot;Two Tickets to Paradise,&quot; which is currently receiving raves on the festival circuit. For his performance in the later film, John C. was awarded Method Fest&apos;s Festival Director&apos;s Award, which is awarded for special recognition/excellence in film.  He is a partner at McGinley Entertainment Inc., an independent film production company with several projects currently in development. John C. first worked both sides of the camera, serving double duty as actor and producer for the romantic comedy &quot;Watch It!&quot; (with Peter Gallagher and Lili Taylor).  For television, he received stunning reviews for his starring role in Dean Koontz&apos;s gripping and highly rated 1997 suspense drama, &quot;Intensity,&quot; a four-hour original film for FOX-TV. Of his performance, the New York Times stated, &quot;John C. McGinley plays &apos;Vess&apos; with effective cold-blooded menace. It is McGinley, in a strong, low-key performance, who emerges as the film&apos;s secret weapon. His face is familiar from many movie roles where his guy-next-door looks have made him a natural sidekick. As the murderer with the unlikely name &apos;Edgler Vess,&apos; he uses that regular-guy demeanor to make the character especially chilling.&quot;</biography>

      <biography>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) and &apos;Robert Rodriguez (I)&apos; (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk them.  Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for Uma Thurman&apos;s role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol. 1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle Barry&apos;s _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv).  Bell&apos;s talent can not only be seen on the big screen but also in the cult television series _&quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; (1995)_ (qv) where she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC thriller _&quot;Alias&quot; (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double for Vicki Pratti.  In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell along with legendary stunt-woman &apos;Jeannie Epper&apos; (qv) give an insight into the career of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated career.  Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes to someday own a home in New Zealand.</biography>

      <biography>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that&apos;s what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others.  After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother&apos;s collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play &quot;Dylan&apos;s Ghost&quot; at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.  Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he&apos;s almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he&apos;s come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director&apos;s second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way&apos;s New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist&apos;s print worth $80.</biography>

He also helped pen _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), which garnered considerable acclaim for reinvigorating the James Bond spy franchise.  In 2007, Haggis wrote, directed and produced _In the Valley of Elah (2007)_ (qv) for Warner Independent Pictures, Samuels Media and Summit Entertainment. The film, which starred &apos;Tommy Lee Jones&apos; (qv), &apos;Charlize Theron&apos; (qv), and &apos;Susan Sarandon&apos; (qv), was a suspense drama of a father&apos;s search for his missing son, who is reported AWOL after returning from Iraq.

It was produced by Highway 61 and Lionsgate Films. Hwy 61 is the production company Haggis formed with his friend and producing partner Michael Nozik. This is their first feature. It was released in November 2010.  Haggis was born in London, Ontario, Canada and moved to California in his early 20s. For over two decades he has written, directed and produced television shows such as _&quot;thirtysomething&quot; (1987)_ (qv) and _&quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; (1987)_ (qv), _&quot;Due South&quot; (1994)_ (qv), _&quot;The Black Donnellys&quot; (2007)_ (qv) and also developed credits as a pup writer on many &apos;Norman Lear&apos; sitcoms. He also created the acclaimed, if short-lived, CBS series _&quot;EZ Streets&quot; (1996)_ (qv) which the New York Times cited as one of the most influential shows of all time, noting, that without it &quot;there would be no Sopranos.&quot;  Haggis is equally committed to his private and social concerns. He is the founder of Artists for Peace and Justice. Under this umbrella, many of his friends in the film business have come forward to build schools and medical clinics serving the children of the slums of Haiti.  He divides his time between residences in Los Angeles and New York.</biography>

      <birthName>Soderbergh, Steven A.</birthName>
      <biography>Steven Soderbergh was born on January 14, 1963, in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the second of six children and, while still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father, &apos;Peter Soderbergh&apos; (qv), was a professor and the dean of the College of Education at Louisiana State University. While still in high school, around the age of 15, Soderbergh enrolled in the university&apos;s film animation class and began making short 16-millimeter films with second-hand equipment, one of which was the short film &quot;Janitor&quot;. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His time there was brief and, shortly after, he returned home and continued making short films and writing scripts.  His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group &apos;Yes&apos; (qv) assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band, which eventually earned him a Grammy nomination for the video, _Yes: 9012 Live (1985) (V)_ (qv). Following this achievement, Soderbergh filmed _Winston (1987)_ (qv), the short-subject film that he would later expand into _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv), a film that earned him the Cannes Film Festival&apos;s Palme d&apos;Or Award, the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Over the next six years, he was married to actress &apos;Betsy Brantley&apos; (qv) and had a daughter named Sarah Soderbergh, who was born in 1990.  Also during this time, he made such films as _Kafka (1991)_ (qv), _King of the Hill (1993)_ (qv), _Underneath (1995)_ (qv) and _Gray&apos;s Anatomy (1996)_ (qv), which many believed to be disappointments. In 1998, Soderbergh made _Out of Sight (1998)_ (qv), his most critically and commercially successful film since _Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989)_ (qv). Then, in 2000, Soderbergh directed two major motion pictures that are now his most successful films to date: _Erin Brockovich (2000)_ (qv) and _Traffic (2000)_ (qv). These films were both nominated for Best Picture Oscars at the 2001 Academy Awards and gave him the first twin director Oscar nomination in almost 60 years and the first ever win. He won the Oscar for Best Director for _Traffic (2000)_ (qv) at the 2001 Oscars.</biography>

      <biography>When you grow up in America&apos;s most dangerous city, Flint, MI, a dream like this seems completely unobtainable and vaguely ludicrous. The external forces of drugs, violence, and poverty exude the power of influence, yet Kay&apos;s internal quest for absolute freedom through acting could not be ignored.  Kay was accepted into Harvard University&apos;s American Repertory Theater/Moscow Art Theatre School Institute in 2013. Her intense desire to achieve greatness and personal freedom pointed Kay to the theater. She has been given the opportunity to channel her once private emotions and experiences in a positive manner. Suddenly, the abandonment caused by her parents&apos; drug and alcohol addictions, the pain caused by premature sensual attention, and her unprecedented level of focus caused by bullies became worth sharing.  In 2004, Kay obtained a B.A. in Communications and a M.A. in Public Relations from Michigan State University, however it led Kay to sitting behind desks, observing human behavior versus standing on stages illuminating human behavior. It was not until she moved to New Orleans in 2010 that she discovered true happiness and the buried talent that was screaming for attention. The film industry started taking the city by storm after Hurricane Katrina, and Kay subconsciously wanted to know more about it.  Kay started as a featured background artist, yet she was handpicked by four Academy Award winners and nominees. Michael Jackson once said, &quot;Study the great and become greater.&quot; Observing and learning from Quentin Tarantino, Gavin Hood, Richard LaGravenese and Lee Daniels caused Kay to take a much-needed inward look. Within one year, she arose from the background and became a principle player.</biography>

After graduating from Florida State with a BA in Media Production, he moved to Los Angeles and produced reality television shows such as _&quot;Ripley&apos;s Believe It or Not!&quot; (1999)_ (qv) and _E!&apos;s Live Countdown to the 2003 Primetime Emmy Awards (2003) (TV)_ (qv).

Since the shift he&apos;s written, acted in and/or produced various independent features, including 2012&apos;s critically acclaimed improvised film _Goodbye Promise (2012)_ (qv), which the LA Times called &quot;a visually alert, enormously well-observed film that deftly captures Hollywood heartbreak,&quot; giving credit to Collins&apos; &quot;appealing and affecting&quot; performance.  Legendary Producer &apos;Fred Roos&apos; (qv) said this about _Goodbye Promise (2012)_ (qv): &quot;On a micro budget, Filmmaker &apos;David Branin&apos; (qv) and Actor &apos;Gregor Collins&apos; (qv) have created a perceptive and touching portrait of the lives of struggling actors working on the fringes of Hollywood.&quot;  In 2008, after a chance meeting with a renowned Holocaust refugee named &apos;Maria Altmann&apos; (qv), Collins became her caregiver for the last three years of her life. In 2012 he published a book about his unique experience called &quot;The Accidental Caregiver,&quot; which subsequently became a bestseller on Amazon.</biography>

      <birthName>Burns, Edward Fitzgerald</birthName>
      <biography>Edward Burns was born on January 28th 1968 in Woodside, Queens New York. The second of three children of Irish-Catholic immigrants. His father Edward J. Burns was a police sergeant and active spokesperson for the New York Police Dept. His mother, Molly, worked for the Federal Aviation Administration at Kennedy Airport. Edward, along with his older sister Mary and brother Brian were raised in Long Island. He attended Catholic Chaminade High School before transferring to a public high school. He went on to attend The State University of New York at Albany and Oneonta College in New York to major in English literature. During his junior year he transferred to Hunter College in Manhattan, studied filmmaking and began writing the first of many short films.  Upon graduating, and through his father&apos;s connections, he secured a job at Entertainment Tonight (1981) (TV) in 1993 working at as a &quot;go-fer&quot;. There he was able to finance and begin working on _The Brothers McMullen (1995)_ (qv), a comedy focusing on the trials and tribulations facing three Irish-Catholic siblings. It was shot primarily in his parents&apos; Long Island home with a cast of unknowns including Burns himself and his then-girlfriend &apos;Maxine Bahns&apos; (qv). The feature was filmed over eight months&apos; time with a reported budget of only $ 30,000. Rejected by a series of distributors, _The Brothers McMullen (1995)_ (qv) bowed at Sundance, after Burns had given &apos;Robert Redford (I)&apos; (qv) a copy of the film while working on ET. In 1995 his film won the festival&apos;s Grand Jury Prize, becoming one of the most successful independent efforts of the year. He then sold the film to 20th Century Fox&apos;s Searchlight Pictures.  For his follow-up Burn&apos;s wrote and directed _She&apos;s the One (1996)_ (qv), which retained much of McMullen&apos;s cast and crew, including girlfriend Maxine. He was also able to cast up-and-coming stars &apos;Jennifer Aniston&apos; (qv) and &apos;Cameron Diaz&apos; (qv) in pivotal roles, with original music from rocker Petty, Tom. Filmed with a larger budget of almost $3 million, the romantic comedy successfully premiered during the summer of 1996 . Burns soon began work on his third feature, _No Looking Back_, a romantic drama set in a coastal town&apos;s working-class community. Burn&apos;s career seemed to be flourishing, but his personal relationship with Bahns, to whom he became engaged, ended after eight years. During filming of _No Looking Back (1998)_ (qv), there were reported romantic sightings with Burns and his co-star &apos;Lauren Holly&apos; (qv). The relationship seemed to end when the film was released in 1998. That same year, Burns co-starred in the &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) World War II epic _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). After that pivotal role in one of the greatest films of all time, Burns continued a good year, and a new relationship with &apos;Heather Graham (I)&apos; (qv). In an interview with USA Weekly Magazine, Heather stated they met in a bar in LA, exchanged numbers and had numerous conversations. Burns then flew back to New York and she flew to east to see him a month later. Soon after Burns and Heather were seen at many premieres and events. It was also reported that couple was living together. But their relationship ended after two years. Although they were dating during the filming of his next project _15 Minutes (2001)_ (qv) starring along side &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv), Burns attended the premiere with none other than &apos;Christy Turlington&apos; (qv). While his next few films did not make much of a dent in the box office including his film _Sidewalks of New York (2001)_ (qv), which co-starred Heather Graham. His relationship with Christy was getting hot and heavy. The couple got engaged in 2001. It was then reported their engagement was called off, but the couple reunited after a 7-month split. Burns and Christy finally married on June 7, 2003 and welcomed their first child Grace, later that year Grace, on October 25. Burns&apos; most recent projects include writing and directing _The Groomsmen (2006)_ (qv) and _Purple Violets (2007)_ (qv). He welcomed his second child, son Finn, (Feb/2006) with wife Christy.  Burns is committed to writing and directing his own films. He&apos;s not affected by his futile work and continues his own projects with poise. Tackling touchy relationship subjects and pioneering real-life matters. With his panoply of &apos;Woody Allen&apos; (qv) -like films, there is no doubt Edward Burns will continue to dazzle us with his undeniable talent while gaining the recognition he deserves as a great writer and director.</biography>

He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young DP&apos;s since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing, he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.</biography>

      <biography>Actor/writer/producer Todd Allen counts &apos;Gregory Peck&apos; (qv), &apos;Marlon Brando&apos; (qv), &apos;Steve McQueen (I)&apos; (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and &apos;Robert Mitchum&apos; (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor.  Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television. He is filming the inspirational sports drama, &quot;My All American&quot; written and directed by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino&apos;s blockbuster Django Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer named, &quot;Dollar Bill.&quot; In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _&quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with &apos;Robert Duvall&apos; (qv) in Duvall&apos;s Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred with Duvall again in AMC&apos;s Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _&quot;Broken Trail&quot; (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of &quot;Marshal Bill Miller,&quot; a man who carries severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan. Other career highlights include three films with &apos;Lawrence Kasdan&apos; (qv), three films with &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv), and playing fighter ace &apos;Chuck Yeager&apos; (qv) in a Hallmark Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television, including appearances on _&quot;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&quot; (2000)_ (qv), _&quot;NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service&quot; (2003)_ (qv), _&quot;Monk&quot; (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv).  Allen will launch an independent media and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay, a gritty, film-noir styled Western, &quot;The Deserters&quot;, was the subject of much competition among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn&apos;t have to do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, &quot;Suicide Grip,&quot; a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. &quot;The Empty Quarter,&quot; is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well in Saudi Arabia&apos;s most barren desert and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; is based on the best selling memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger along the volatile Texas/Mexico border.  Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.</biography>

      <biography>Alan Cumming was born on January 27, 1965, in Aberfeldy, Scotland. His family lived nearby in Dunkeld, where his father, Alex, was a forester for Atholl Estate. The family (Alex, mother Mary, big brother Tom and Alan) moved to Fassfern near Fort William soon after, before moving to the east coast of Scotland in 1969 where Alan&apos;s dad took up the position of Head Forester of Panmure Estate, and it was here Alan grew up. He went to Monikie Primary School and Carnoustie High School, where he began appearing in plays, and soon after that began working with with the Carnoustie Theatre Club and Carnoustie Musical Society. In 1981 he left high school with 8 &apos;O&apos; Grades and 4 Highers, but because he was too young to enter any university or drama school he worked for just over a year as a sub-editor at D.C. Thomson Publishers in Dundee. There he worked on the launch of a new magazine, &quot;Tops&quot;, and was also the &quot;Young Alan&quot; who answered readers&apos; letters. In September 1982 he began a three-year course at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow. He graduated in 1985 with a B.A. (Dramatic Studies) and awards for verse speaking and direction. He also had formed a cabaret double act with fellow student &apos;Forbes Masson&apos; (qv) called Victor and Barry, which went on to become hugely successful with tours (including two Perrier Pick of the Fringe seasons in London and a month-long engagement at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian tour), records (&quot;Hear Victor and Barry and Faint&quot;, &quot;Are We Too Loud?&quot;) and many TV appearances throughout the UK. Before graduating Alan made his professional theater and film debuts in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow and in &apos;Gillies MacKinnon&apos; (qv)&apos;s &quot;Passing Glory&quot;. After graduating Alan worked extensively in Scottish theater and television, including a stint on the soap opera _&quot;Take the High Road&quot; (1980)_ (qv) before moving to London when &quot;Conquest of the South Pole&quot;, a play by German playwright &apos;Manfred Karge&apos; (qv), transferred from the Traverse Theatre in, Edinburgh to the the Royal Court in London, earning him his first Olivier award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer of 1988.  Alan performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and then the Royal National Theatre, where he starred in &quot;Accidental Death of an Anarchist&quot;, which he also adapted with director &apos;Tim Supple&apos; (qv). The production was nominated for Best revival at the 1991 Olivier awards and Alan won for Comedy Performance of the Year. Then his film career began with &apos;Ian Sellar (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Prague (1992)_ (qv), in which he starred with &apos;Sandrine Bonnaire&apos; (qv) and &apos;Bruno Ganz&apos; (qv). The film premiered at the 1992 Cannes film festival and went on to win him Best Actor award at the Atlantic Film Festival and a Scottish BAFTA Best Actor nomination. In the same year he made two films for the BBC - _&quot;Screen Two&quot; (1985) {The Last Romantics (#8.11)}_ (qv) and _Bernard and the Genie (1991) (TV)_ (qv), the latter winning him the Top Television Newcomer award at 1992 British Comedy Awards. In the 1992 Olivier awards he was also nominated for Comedy Performance of the Year for &quot;La Bete&quot;. In 1993 he played Hamlet for the English Touring Theare to great critical acclaim (&quot;An actor knocking on the door of greatness&quot; - Daily Mail; ranked first and second--with his performance in &quot;Cabaret&quot;--in the Daily Telegraph&apos;s performances of the year) and then immediately went on to play the Emcee in &apos;Sam Mendes (I)&apos; (qv)&apos; revival of &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the same venue (London&apos;s Donmar Warehouse). He received a 1994 Olivier award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for &quot;Cabaret&quot;, and for Hamlet he received the 1994 TMA Best Actor award and a Shakespeare Globe award nomination.  In 1994 he made his first Hollywood film, _Circle of Friends (1995)_ (qv), and his performance as the oleaginous Sean Walsh along with those in two films released in quick succession (_Emma (1996)_ (qv) and _GoldenEye (1995)_ (qv)) brought him to the attention of American producers, and he appeared in several Hollywood films, such as _Romy and Michele&apos;s High School Reunion (1997)_ (qv) and _Buddy (1997)_ (qv). He returned to the UK in 1997 to work with &apos;Stanley Kubrick&apos; (qv) and the &apos;Spice Girls&apos; (qv) before returning stateside in 1998 to reprise his role in &quot;Cabaret&quot; on Broadway. The show and his portrayal were a sensation, and he received the Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics&apos; Circle, Theatre World, FANY, New York Press and New York Public Advocate&apos;s awards for his performance. Since then he has alternated between theater and films, and also between smaller independent films and more mainstream fare. His theater work includes 2001&apos;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; on Broadway and the hugely successful off-Broadway &quot;Elle&quot; by &apos;Jean Genet&apos; (qv), which he adapted and played the lead in 2002. Films have included &apos;Julie Taymor&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Titus (1999)_ (qv), _Urbania (2000)_ (qv), the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; trilogy, _Josie and the Pussycats (2001)_ (qv), _X2 (2003)_ (qv), _Nicholas Nickleby (2002)_ (qv), _Son of the Mask (2005)_ (qv) and the Showtime movie musical _Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical (2005) (TV)_ (qv). He wrote, directed, produced and acted in _The Anniversary Party (2001)_ (qv) with &apos;Jennifer Jason Leigh&apos; (qv), which premiered at the Cannes Film festival in 2002 and went on to win a National Board of Review award and two Independent Spirit award nominations. More recently he has produced the documentary Show People (2004) and the films _Sweet Land (2005)_ (qv) and _Full Grown Men (2006)_ (qv) (and appears in both) and acted in _Gray Matters (2006/I)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Heather Graham (I)&apos; (qv) and _Bam Bam and Celeste (2005)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Margaret Cho&apos; (qv). in 2006 he will return to Broadway as Macheath in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. He has also found the time to write a novel, &quot;Tommy&apos;s Tale&quot;, in 2002 and a fragrance, &quot;Cumming&quot; in 2005.</biography>

      <biography>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the &quot;splatter movie&quot; explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends &apos;Dick Smith (II)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Rob Bottin&apos; (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-&apos;90s. Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor &apos;Lon Chaney&apos; (qv), and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark of Chaney&apos;s career. In Savini&apos;s insightful book &quot;Grande Illusions&quot;, he speaks of his early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using &quot;spearmint gum&quot;, having misinterpreted that he was meant to actually use &quot;spirit gum&quot;!  His first work was in low-budget fare, providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_ (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs with his grisly effects in the cult &apos;George A. Romero (I)&apos; (qv)-directed zombie film _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned &quot;splatter movie&quot; genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow (1982)_ (qv) and Romero&apos;s third &quot;Dead&quot; film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which he won a Saturn Award).  In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films, and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as &quot;Morgan, the Black Knight&quot; in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as &quot;Blades&quot;, one of the biker gang members in _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as &quot;Sex Machine&quot;, another leather-clad biker--but this time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv).</biography>

After a few bit parts, Holly landed a leading role as Kimberly in TV drama _&quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1992)_ (qv). This show ran for 4 years, winning Holly critical acclaim and a Young Actors award.

Then in 1998, Holly&apos;s good friend &apos;Shannen Doherty&apos; (qv) told her about a new television show based around three sisters who happen to be witches, who save the world from evil. Holly auditioned for the middle sister, won the role and is now known world wide for her portrayal of Piper Halliwell in the WB smash hit show _&quot;Charmed&quot; (1998)_ (qv). Holly now lives in Burbank with her husband and their three sons.</biography>

      <birthDateAsString>29 November 1961</birthDateAsString>
      <birthName>Jr., Thomas Edward Sizemore</birthName>
      <biography>Tom Sizemore rose in prominence throughout the 1990s, establishing himself as a memorable tough-guy character, sought by the most respected directors in the business. Born in Detroit on November 29, 1961, Sizemore grew up idolizing the tough-guy characters of the movies he watched. After attending Wayne State University, he got his master&apos;s degree in theatre from Temple University in 1986.  Like many, he moved to New York City and struggled, waiting tables and performing in plays. His first break came when &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv) cast him in a bit part in _Born on the Fourth of July (1989)_ (qv). Bigger roles soon followed throughout the early 1990s, such as _Guilty by Suspicion (1991)_ (qv), _True Romance (1993)_ (qv), and _Striking Distance (1993)_ (qv). 1994 proved to be an even bigger year for Sizemore, as he won the role of &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; in &apos;Kevin Costner&apos; (qv)&apos;s star-studded biopic _Wyatt Earp (1994)_ (qv), as well as one of his first truly memorable roles as &quot;Detective Jack Scagnetti&quot; in &apos;Oliver Stone (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s controversial _Natural Born Killers (1994)_ (qv). In 1995 he appeared in _Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)_ (qv), _Strange Days (1995)_ (qv), as well as the acclaimed crime epic _Heat (1995)_ (qv), directed by &apos;Michael Mann (I)&apos; (qv). Sizemore&apos;s first big leading role is in _The Relic (1997)_ (qv), the big-budget effects thriller directed by &apos;Peter Hyams&apos; (qv).  According to a 2001 interview in The Calgary Sun, Sizemore entered a drug rehabilitation program in 1998 after his mother and his friend &apos;Robert De Niro&apos; (qv) appeared on his door-step during the filming of _Witness to the Mob (1998) (TV)_ (qv). Telling him they were there to drive him to jail or to rehabilitation, Sizemore chose the latter. After completing rehabilitation, he counseled adolescents involved in substance abuse.  Offered roles in W.W.II films directed by both &apos;Terrence Malick&apos; (qv) and &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv), Sizemore chose the role of &quot;Sergeant Horvath&quot; in _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv). The role and film received wide acclaim and introduced Sizemore&apos;s talents to a much broader audience in a more human and well-rounded role than he had previously been given. Sizemore also credits this shoot and &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) for helping him with his recovery from addiction, with &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) threatening to reshoot the entire film if Sizemore failed a drug test even once.  After a flamboyant and uncredited mobster role in _Enemy of the State (1998)_ (qv), Sizemore then portrayed a psychotic paramedic in _Bringing Out the Dead (1999)_ (qv) directed by &apos;Martin Scorsese&apos; (qv). Seemingly taking it easy, he then turned in fine but stereotypical performances in _Play It to the Bone (1999)_ (qv), _Red Planet (2000)_ (qv), and _Pearl Harbor (2001)_ (qv). Sizemore then received another leading role in the high-profile military drama _Black Hawk Down (2001)_ (qv) directed by yet another legendary director, &apos;Ridley Scott&apos; (qv).  Specializing in the sort of ultimate tough-guy/manly man roles that hearken back to a different era in film, Sizemore continues to be a favourite of Hollywood&apos;s greatest directors. Never afraid to speak his mind about anyone and anything, his sense of blunt honesty and lack of pretension is refreshing. A commanding voice and presence on film, Sizemore looks to continue as one of Hollywood&apos;s greatest actors.</biography>

      <akaNames class="linked-list"/>
      <gender>FEMALE</gender>
      <birthDateAsString>10 March 1978</birthDateAsString>
      <biography>Originally from a tourist town in Canada, Cardinal was shuffled around until she ended up in foster care. At 12 years old, she co-founded a peer counseling organization dedicated to assisting children suffering from sexual abuse. By 16 she&apos;d decided to move to the US to live the American dream, working 3 jobs to make ends meet. At 19, misdiagnosed with cancer and only holding a grade 7 education, she turned her life around, went back to school and earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in Psychology on full scholarship. A natural leader, she was unanimously elected president of the theatre club and held that position until she graduated. It was then she knew the movie business was the only place for her. Still in school and working a full time corporate job, she booked the female lead in the Warner Brother&apos;s slasher flick &quot;Delivery&quot;. Soon, other offers came in. While juggling a budding film career, University and a full time job, she honed her improv skills at the Florida Renaissance Festival. Her first year performing as a man, because the festival director wouldn&apos;t let her sword fight as a woman.  A few films later, Cardinal combined the skills she&apos;d learned at her corporate job, her love of the Renaissance and sword play, and her name as an up and comer to create &quot;Legend of the Red Reaper&quot;. Seasoned pros and aspirings alike flocked to her side and the project took on a life of its own. No sooner was production underway than adversity came with it. Midway through filming, a co-production company embezzled 40% of the production funds - but Tara used her credit, her savings, and finally her own home to make up the difference. But it wasn&apos;t enough, and all of her above the line crew quit when the money ran out. Cardinal taught herself screen writing, submitted her body to a 4 month invasive medical study and became a professional wrestler to raise the money to finish the shoot. With no other producers on set, she promoted all of her department heads to producer and went on to direct and produce, while staring in the film. Her cast and crew stood by her side and the film was finished within months. Post production offered a new set of challenges. Over 120 minutes of footage was lost by a shady post house. Three editors failed to complete so much as a rough cut. One distribution company tried to extort the film from Cardinal, trying to use her hard won film as b-roll and putting Steven Segal in the lead. Cardinal held her ground and her movie, even when the big shots threatened to sue.  Finally, she caught the attention of movie mogul Uwe Boll, who took one look at the assembly her third editor compiled - and unfortunately passed.  Resolute, she made him a deal. If she edited a new cut, would he reconsider? He would and she did. But first, she had to learn how to edit. When Uwe Boll saw her cut, he decided on the spot to not only rep the movie, but to throw his full weight behind the project, bringing on an award winning post production team. Helmed by Cardinal, the movie was recut, colored and scored to reflect a new vision. As Cardinal evolved, so did the film. Cardinal polished the film with a personal narration, bringing the final product together as one cohesive unit.  In the midst of finishing Red Reaper, another project fell into her lap. Half finished, with 9 of 19 reels destroyed in a freak Fed-Ex accident, Cardinal put her skills to work, re-writing, re-casting, and re-shooting &quot;Scarlet Samurai&quot; (which originally went by the title &quot;Terminal Descent&quot;). Cardinal based the lead character on her martial arts master Sean Wyn, who trained her in both the physical and spiritual martial arts, creating a part Asian, part Jewish (lesbian) superhero infused with powers by her training in Buddhism. Cardinal not only stars as the samurai in training, but plays her own twin. She also co-edited both sound and picture, audio-mixed, color graded and did some of the visual effects.  In addition to creating two feature films, Cardinal also co-authored a novel based on the Red Reaper characters with fantasy novelist Alex Bledsoe. She is in talks to do a short run comic series for both properties and released an ashcan version of Red Reaper, featuring the art of George Perez at San Diego Comicon. She continues to accept roles in movies of all genres and her spare time gathers her celebrity friends for charity events at Dark Delicacies in Burbank. Since moving to Hollywood, California she has raised over $10,000 for charity to relieve the Tsunami victims in Japan, the earthquake victims in Haiti and Chile, Homeless youth and abandoned dogs in Los Angeles.  She currently resides in Hollywood California where she is catching up on some much needed sleep in between producing charity events, writing novels and comic books, and creating superheros.</biography>

      <birthName>Willis, Walter Bruce</birthName>
      <biography>Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for his film appearances as wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts. Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in West Germany, to an American father and a German mother, who were living on a United States military base. He was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly &quot;discovered&quot; whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.  After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye &quot;David Addison&quot; alongside sultry &apos;Cybill Shepherd&apos; (qv) in the hit romantic comedy television series _&quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985)_ (qv). The series firmly established Bruce Willis as a hot new talent, and his sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. was in effect a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective &quot;John McClane&quot; in the monster hit _Die Hard (1988)_ (qv). This superbly paced action film balanced laconic humor and wholesale destruction as Willis&apos; character single handedly battles a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Willis reprized the role of tough guy cop &quot;John McClane&quot; in the eagerly anticipated sequel _Die Hard 2 (1990)_ (qv) set at snowbound Washington&apos;s Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel _Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)_ (qv) this time also starring &apos;Samuel L. Jackson&apos; (qv) as a cynical Harlem shopowner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in NYC.  Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of &quot;Mikey&quot; the baby in the very popular family comedies _Look Who&apos;s Talking (1989)_ (qv), and its sequel _Look Who&apos;s Talking Too (1990)_ (qv) also starring &apos;John Travolta (I)&apos; (qv) and &apos;Kirstie Alley&apos; (qv). Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. _The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)_ (qv) and _Hudson Hawk (1991)_ (qv) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyperviolent _The Last Boy Scout (1991)_ (qv), the darkly humored _Death Becomes Her (1992)_ (qv) and the mediocre police thriller _Striking Distance (1993)_ (qv). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing _North (1994)_ (qv), as a cagey prizefighter in the &apos;Quentin Tarantino&apos; (qv) directed mega-hit _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv), the &apos;Terry Gilliam&apos; (qv) directed apocalyptic thriller _Twelve Monkeys (1995)_ (qv), the &apos;Luc Besson&apos; (qv) directed sci-fi opus _The Fifth Element (1997)_ (qv) and the &apos;M. Night Shyamalan&apos; (qv) directed spine-tingling epic _The Sixth Sense (1999)_ (qv).  Willis next starred in the gangster comedy _The Whole Nine Yards (2000)_ (qv), worked again with &quot;hot&quot; director &apos;M. Night Shyamalan&apos; (qv) in the less gripping _Unbreakable (2000)_ (qv), and in two military dramas, _Hart&apos;s War (2002)_ (qv) and _Tears of the Sun (2003)_ (qv) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded &apos;Frank Miller (II)&apos; (qv) graphic novel turned movie _Sin City (2005)_ (qv), the voice of &quot;RJ&quot; the scheming raccoon in the animated hit _Over the Hedge (2006)_ (qv) and &quot;Die Hard&quot; fans rejoiced to see &quot;John McClane&quot; return to the big screen in the high tech _Live Free or Die Hard (2007)_ (qv) aka &quot;Die Hard 4.0&quot;.  Willis was married to actress &apos;Demi Moore&apos; (qv) for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three children.</biography>

      <biography>Canadian-born actor Nathan Fillion gained critical acclaim and a large cult of fans when he starred as Captain Malcolm Reynolds on the &apos;Joss Whedon&apos; (qv) TV series _&quot;Firefly&quot; (2002)_ (qv), having previously been a regular on _&quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1968)_ (qv) and _&quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot; (1998)_ (qv). Fillion had also appeared in small roles in the films _Blast from the Past (1999)_ (qv) and _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv).  Whedon gave Fillion a chance to display his range when he cast Fillion as the twisted preacher Caleb, a villain, in the seventh and final season of _&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997)_ (qv).  When _&quot;Firefly&quot; (2002)_ (qv) was prematurely canceled in late 2002, the show&apos;s cast, crew, and many fans were devastated. Whedon vowed to resurrect the series in some way, and Fillion played Captain Reynolds again in the feature-film _Serenity (2005)_ (qv). Fillion followed this film with more big screen leading roles in the horror-comedy _Slither (2006)_ (qv) and the indie hit _Waitress (2007)_ (qv). He also continued to be a force in television, starring in the short-lived Fox-TV series _&quot;Drive&quot; (2007)_ (qv) and appearing on ABC&apos;s _&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004)_ (qv). He took his first singing part (and cemented his cult appeal) as Captain Hammer in Whedon&apos;s musical Internet smash _&quot;Dr. Horrible&apos;s Sing-Along Blog&quot; (2008)_ (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Actor Simon Kunz was born on 8 May 1954, the same year that his American-born, England domiciled grandfather, the pianist Charlie Kunz, had a Top Twenty hit with Piano Medley 114. After leaving the Latymer School Simon read Theatre Studies at Warwick University and in 1984 became the drummer in the band the Locomotives. However, rather than follow Charlie into the music business he left the group after a year to concentrate on acting. On stage he appeared with the National Theatre (Brackenbury in &apos;Richard III&apos;), the Oxford Stage Company (Oliver in &apos;As You Like It&apos;, Edgar in &apos;King Lear&apos;)in &apos;The Caretaker&apos; at the Bristol Old Vic, &apos;Live Like Pigs&apos; at the Royal Court and &apos;The Park&apos; with the Royal Shakespeare Company, making his film debut in &apos;Four Weddings and a Funeral&apos;. On television he has appeared in most of the populist dramas where he seems to have played rather more than his fair share of policemen - of all ranks - and lawyers.</biography>

      <biography>Jennifer Garner, who has catapulted into stardom with her lead role on the television series _&quot;Alias&quot; (2001)_ (qv), has come a long way from her birthplace of Houston, Texas. Raised in Charleston, West Virginia by her mother Pat, a retired English teacher, and her father, Bill, a former chemical engineer, Jennifer was the middle sibling of three girls. She spent nine years of her adolescence studying ballet and describes her years in dance as ones characterized by determination rather than talent, being driven mostly by a love of the stage.  Jennifer took this determination with her when she enrolled at Denison University as a chemistry major, a decision that was later changed to a drama major when she found that her passions for the stage were stronger than her love of science. New York attracted the young actress after college where she worked as a hostess while pursuing a career in film and television. Her most recent move has been to Los Angeles, a decision that led to a role on the television series _&quot;Felicity&quot; (1998)_ (qv), where she met her future husband &apos;Scott Foley (I)&apos; (qv). The couple divorced in 2004.  Jennifer appears on television as Agent Sydney Bristow, who works for the Central Intelligence Agency. For her work, Garner has received four consecutive Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. She has also received four Golden Globe nominations and won once, as well as received two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, and won once. She has appeared in numerous other television production as well as such films as _Elektra (2005)_ (qv), _13 Going on 30 (2004)_ (qv), _Daredevil (2003)_ (qv), _Pearl Harbor (2001)_ (qv) and _Dude, Where&apos;s My Car? (2000)_ (qv). Aside from filming _&quot;Alias&quot; (2001)_ (qv), Jennifer enjoys cooking, gardening, hiking, and inspired by her character on the series, kickboxing.</biography>

      <biography>Richard was the middle of three sons born to Edward, a real estate lawyer, and Charlotte, a cable TV and publishing executive. His parents divorced when he was 12. He dropped out of high school but obtained an equivalency diploma. He tried studying at the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1973, but had no interest. After not bothering to show up for finals, he headed to Colorado where he cut firewood and lived a hippie life. He returned to New York in 1975 and started studying acting at CCNY and eventually was accepted into their theater program. He initially disliked acting and studied to be a director. He directed several off-Broadway plays, including &quot;Antigone&quot; with a then just-graduated &apos;Angela Bassett&apos; (qv) in 1983. He also met present wife, &apos;Sheila Kelley (I)&apos; (qv), during auditions for this play. The two married in 1996. In the mid-1980s, Richard says he conquered his fears and decided to take a stab at acting. He got several TV roles, but he was seen by &apos;Steven Spielberg&apos; (qv) in an episode of the TV drama _&quot;High Incident&quot; (1996)_ (qv). Speilberg then cast him in _The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)_ (qv) and his career has been on an upward climb ever since that has lead to his co-starring role in _&quot;The West Wing&quot; (1999)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Presnell, George Harvey</birthName>
      <biography>By the time handsome, brawny baritone Harve Presnell arrived on the film scene, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of musicals had long dissipated. Born in Modesto, California in 1933, he graduated from Modesto High School and received a USC sports scholarship, but moved quickly to singing. Initially training for an operatic career, he spent three seasons singing throughout Europe. He was performing nationally, however, when the opportunity for Broadway first came his way. Legendary composer &apos;Meredith Willson&apos; (qv) happened to catch an earful of the gifted singer in concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles and, in the virile mold of &apos;Alfred Drake&apos; (qv) and &apos;Howard Keel&apos; (qv), wrote the role of Johnny &quot;Leadville&quot; Brown in &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; specifically for him. The Broadway musical, with &apos;Tammy Grimes&apos; (qv) as the spunky title heroine, was a resounding hit as Harve wrapped his glorious tonsils around such sturdy, wide-stanced songs as &quot;Colorado, My Home&quot; and &quot;I&apos;ll Never Say No.&quot; Unlike Grimes, Presnell was granted the opportunity to recreate his rags-to-riches part when the celluloid version of _The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964)_ (qv) came out with a bankable film star, the indomitable &apos;Debbie Reynolds (I)&apos; (qv), inhabiting the backwoods role. The film version was also hugely popular with audiences and Harve, with his terrific presence. seemed well on his way to stardom.  There were precious few movie musicals, however, for Presnell to sink his teeth into and he quickly faded from view. He tried adjusting to straight dramatics with the rugged western _The Glory Guys (1965)_ (qv) and sang again in the highly unworthy teen frolic _When the Boys Meet the Girls (1965)_ (qv) with &apos;Connie Francis&apos; (qv), but little else came in his direction. The disastrous film version of _Paint Your Wagon (1969)_ (qv), hurt by the miscasting of leads &apos;Lee Marvin (I)&apos; (qv), &apos;Clint Eastwood&apos; (qv) and &apos;Jean Seberg&apos; (qv), was redeemed only by the presence of Presnell and his superb, moving rendition of &quot;They Call the Wind Mariah&quot;.  By the 70s Harve was finished in films but gamely kept his momentum with Keel-like stock and touring leads in such productions as &quot;Camelot,&quot; &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot; and &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,&quot; among others. He even played Rhett Butler in a 1972 musical version of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; at London&apos;s Drury Lane Theatre, but the production did not generate much of a stir. In 1979, Presnell served as a replacement in the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot; as Daddy Warbucks and wound up staying employed as the blustery but big-hearted moneybags for nearly 4 years on tour, also reprising the role in the failed 90s sequel &quot;Annie II: Miss Hannigan&apos;s Revenge&quot; (1989), which was later reworked and retitled &quot;Annie Warbucks&quot; (1992). All tolled, it is estimated that Harve played the tycoon role over 2,000 times.  More than 25 years had passed by the time Presnell returned to the movies as a brash and balding character actor. He struck pure gold as the implacable, ill-fated father-in-law of &apos;William H. Macy&apos; (qv) in the Coen Brothers&apos; cult film hit _Fargo (1996)_ (qv). This success, in turn, led to meaty roles in _Larger Than Life (1996)_ (qv), _The Whole Wide World (1996)_ (qv), _The Chamber (1996)_ (qv), _Face/Off (1997)_ (qv), _Saving Private Ryan (1998)_ (qv) and _The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000)_ (qv), to name a few. Over the course of his career, he displayed a strong presence on TV as well with recurring roles on prime-time (&quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;) and daytime (&quot;Ryan&apos;s Hope&quot;). Presnell may have been born 10-20 years too late to have become a singing film star, but he suddenly had come back in spades to launch a whole new career as a noted character performer. At age 70+ he was unsinkable, vigorously steamrolling on TV (&quot;The Pretender,&quot; &quot;The Monk&quot; and &quot;ER&quot;) and in the films _Mr. Deeds (2002)_ (qv), _Old School (2003)_ (qv), _Flags of Our Fathers (2006)_ (qv) and _Evan Almighty (2007)_ (qv). His last series role was in the short-lived _&quot;Andy Barker, P.I.&quot; (2007)_ (qv).  Pancreatic cancer got the best of the actor in his final years. The twice-married actor with six children (Stephanie, Taylor, Etoile, Tulley, Shannon and Raine) succumbed to his illness at the St. John&apos;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California on June 30, 2009, at age 76.</biography>

      <biography>Richard Roundtree was a leading man in many &quot;blaxploitation&quot; movies in the 1970s. He is best known for his role as John Shaft in _Shaft (1971)_ (qv), and starred in its two sequels as well. As the 1970s and 1980s progressed he starred more in low-budget movies. He was in a few occasional high-profile, if a tad offbeat, films. Among his more notable work in that period were _Escape to Athena (1979)_ (qv), _City Heat (1984)_ (qv) and the socially conscious but badly received _Game for Vultures (1979)_ (qv). Roundtree has been active in movies these days. He became popular again in the 1990s with his role in _Se7en (1995)_ (qv), and was well received for reprising his role as the classic hero, and &apos;Samuel L. Jackson&apos; (qv)&apos;s uncle, in the 2000 remake of the film that made him a star, _Shaft (2000)_ (qv).</biography>

      <birthName>Green, Eva Gaëlle</birthName>
      <biography>Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a non-identical twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film _Au hasard Balthazar (1966)_ (qv). Her mother, &apos;Marlène Jobert&apos; (qv), is an actress who retired from acting and became a writer of children&apos;s books. Eva&apos;s mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva&apos;s father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University.  She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: &quot;La Jalousie en Trois Fax&quot; and &quot;Turcaret&quot;. There she caught the eye of director &apos;Bernardo Bertolucci&apos; (qv). Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with &apos;Bernardo Bertolucci&apos; (qv). During their work Bertolucci described Green as being &quot;so beautiful it&apos;s indecent.&quot; Green won critical acclaim for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score.  After The Dreamers Green&apos;s career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer _Arsène Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite &apos;Romain Duris&apos; (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite &apos;Orlando Bloom&apos; (qv) and &apos;Liam Neeson&apos; (qv) in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by &apos;Ridley Scott&apos; (qv). The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in The Black Dahlia that went to &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv) because she didn&apos;t want to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead, Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite &apos;Daniel Craig (I)&apos; (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl after &apos;Claudine Auger&apos; (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), &apos;Corinne Cléry (I)&apos; (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), &apos;Carole Bouquet&apos; (qv) in _For Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and &apos;Sophie Marceau&apos; (qv) in The World is not enough (1999).  Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can&apos;t speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.</biography>

      <birthName>Gill, Jimmy Lee</birthName>
      <biography>His legal name is Jimmy Lee Gill. His professional name is Seth Bailey. He has been a performing clown almost his entire life.  Early 1950&apos;s, as a pre-school child Jimmy&apos;s Grandfather, the former world renowned circus clown Seth Walter Bailey also and better known as &quot;Bill Bailey&quot; would make-up and costumed Jimmy as a clown then take the miniature clown along on gigs.  Late 1960&apos;s, Jimmy began his professional career at the age of 16 with summer employment at the Memphis Zoological Garden as a clown for its daily one-ring circus. Tommy O&apos;Brian, the former world renowned circus animal trainer, directed this two-shows-a-day gig. Jimmy used Grandpa Bailey&apos;s make-up kit and costume. He did a bald Whiteface 2-piece clown suit and tie entity.  Early 1970&apos;s, Jimmy became a member of the Al Chymia Shriners&apos; Clown Unit in Memphis, Tennessee. He continued to use Grandpa Bailey&apos;s make-up kit and costume. He did a red mop wigged Whiteface ragged Andy type entity. All of the Clown Unit&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes. One May they dressed for 20 events. One Memorial Day weekend, they raised over $6,500 for the &quot;Muscular Dystrophy Association&apos;s Telethon&quot; by collecting change from passing motorists at a major Memphis street intersection.  Late 1980&apos;s, Jimmy became a member of the Woodland Hills Shriners&apos; Clown Club in Los Angeles, California. He now had his own much larger make-up kit and a couple of his own costumes. He introduced two new personal clown entities: Hobo 01 and Auguste 04. All of this Clown Club&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes. They regularly visited nursing homes to entertained seniors. They also dressed for as many holiday parades as possible and children&apos;s causes such as the &quot;Juvenile Diabetes Foundation&quot;.  Early 1990&apos;s, Jimmy co-founded and became a charter member of the Al Malaikah Shriners&apos; Clown Unit in Los Angeles, California. He continued doing Hobo 01 and Auguste 04 while developing three new personal clown entities: Tramp 02, Auguste 03 and Whiteface 05. All of the Clown Unit&apos;s gigs were for charitable causes including weekly visited the Shriners&apos; Hospital for Children.  Mid 1990&apos;s, responding to numerous requests, Jimmy began to voluntarily teach clowning skills to non-profit groups: churches, community recreational centers, fraternities, etc. During this endeavor, he had the pleasure of creating an unknown number of clown entities for others of all ages, children to seniors. Each of these clown troops furthered local charities as their purpose.  Late 1997, One of Jimmy&apos;s former clown students, AEA/AFTRA/AGVA/SAG member &apos;Sherri McKenzie&apos; (qv), recommended him to a Casting Director for a role as a clown in the feature film remake titled _Carnival of Souls (1998)_ (qv). He was booked and worked that project as Hobo 01. He found this new creative outlet quite thrilling, desired more of it and pursued it with new found passion.  Early 1998, Jimmy became a member of AFTRA and SAG. Since then, he&apos;s worked under the jurisdiction of both unions on being called. He continued to do Hobo 01, Tramp 02, Auguste 03, Auguste 04 and Whiteface 05 while developing four new personal clown entities: Whiteface 06, Mime 07, Character 08 and Character 09. Jimmy now adopted the professional name of Seth Bailey to honor Grandpa Bailey, from whence his roots grow. By virtue of his work Jimmy&apos;s earned eligibility to join AEA.  Late 1998, Jimmy was asked if he could duplicate John Wayne Gacy&apos;s &quot;Pogo the Clown&quot; entity for the feature television film titled _Men in White (1998) (TV)_ (qv). An Internet search provided a color image of Gacy&apos;s sinister clown entity which Jimmy did duplicate as requested.  Early 2000, Jimmy volunteered to help the &quot;Make-A-Wish Foundation of Greater Los Angeles&quot; grant a terminally ill young boy&apos;s wish of having a clown host his birthday party. Jimmy worked the party of family and friends as Auguste 03 with: balloon sculptures, comedic stich, face painting, juggling, and magic (both stage and close-up). Efern&apos;s face beamed joy and his excitement was contagious! This sadly, turned out to be Efern&apos;s last birthday as he succumbed to leukemia. Jimmy&apos;s still on-call for Make-A-Wish.  Mid 2000, Jimmy&apos;s voluntarily worked several fund-raisers for the &quot;Starlight Children&apos;s Foundation&quot;. Jimmy&apos;s also still on-call for Starlight.  Jimmy continues working gigs for charitable causes, AFTRA and SAG. He now additionally offers his services for corporate events, i.e. a specially designed iconic entity, spokesman, grand openings, annual parties, etc. He has worked one Hollywood Studio Producer&apos;s Christmas Party as Mime 07. He is a professional clown in both appearance and entertainment quality.</biography>

      <birthName>Butler, Gerard James</birthName>
      <biography>Born in Paisley, Scotland, to Margaret and Edward Butler, Gerard Butler was raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley, Scotland. He also spent some of his youth in Canada. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school&apos;s law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.  His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor &apos;Steven Berkoff (I)&apos; (qv), who later appeared alongside Butler in _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv), who gave him a role in a stage production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;. After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as &apos;Ewan McGregor&apos; (qv)&apos;s character &quot;Renton&quot; in the stage adaptation of [i]Trainspotting[/i]. His film debut was as &apos;Billy Connolly (I)&apos; (qv)&apos;s younger brother in _Mrs Brown (1997)_ (qv). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.  His film career continued with small roles, first in the &quot;James Bond&quot; movie, _Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)_ (qv), and then &apos;Russell Mulcahy&apos; (qv)&apos;s _Tale of the Mummy (1998)_ (qv). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being &quot;Attila the Hun&quot; in the USA Network mini-series, _Attila (2001/I) (TV)_ (qv). The film&apos;s producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler&apos;s screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time &quot;Attila&quot; was being filmed, casting was in progress for &apos;Wes Craven&apos; (qv)&apos;s new take on the &quot;Dracula&quot; legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn&apos;t much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of &quot;Attila&quot;. Evidently, they saw something because _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila&apos;s producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film&apos;s ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on _Dracula 2000 (2000)_ (qv). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, an Internet site and began appearing on lists everywhere.  Since then, he has appeared in _Reign of Fire (2002)_ (qv) as &quot;Creedy&quot; and _Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life (2003)_ (qv) as &quot;Terry Sheridan&quot;, alongside &apos;Angelina Jolie&apos; (qv). The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of &quot;Andre Marek&quot; in the big-screen adaptation of &apos;Michael Crichton&apos; (qv)&apos;s novel, _Timeline (2003)_ (qv). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in &apos;Andrew Lloyd Webber&apos; (qv)&apos;s musical, _The Phantom of the Opera (2004)_ (qv), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention. Other projects include _Dear Frankie (2004)_ (qv), _The Game of Their Lives (2005)_ (qv) and _Beowulf &amp; Grendel (2005)_ (qv).  In 2007, he starred as Spartan &quot;King Leonidas&quot; in the Warner Bros. production _300 (2006)_ (qv), based on the &apos;Frank Miller (II)&apos; (qv) graphic novel, and _Butterfly on a Wheel (2007)_ (qv), co-starring &apos;Pierce Brosnan&apos; (qv) and &apos;Maria Bello&apos; (qv), which aired on network TV under the title, &quot;Shattered&quot;. He most recently starred in _P.S. I Love You (2007)_ (qv), with Academy Award-winner &apos;Hilary Swank&apos; (qv).  In 2007, he appeared in _Nim&apos;s Island (2008)_ (qv) and _RocknRolla (2008)_ (qv), and completed the new &apos;Mark Neveldine&apos; (qv) / &apos;Brian Taylor (V)&apos; (qv) film, _Gamer (2009)_ (qv). His next films included _The Ugly Truth (2009)_ (qv), co-starring &apos;Katherine Heigl&apos; (qv), which began filming in April 2008, _The Bounty Hunter (2010/I)_ (qv), _How to Train Your Dragon (2010)_ (qv), _Chasing Mavericks (2012)_ (qv) and _Olympus Has Fallen (2013)_ (qv). Butler is also a relative of rising animator and film director &apos;Mark Flood (III)&apos; (qv).</biography>

      <biography>Takara was born the youngest of 2 in Washington, DC. She never had an interest in politics so she spent the majority of her adolescence a student athlete, with quixotic dreams of being an Olympic gymnast and lawyer.  Takara got her first taste of the stage as &quot;Orchid&quot; in her school&apos;s production of Rose Petal&apos;s Place at the age of 7. However, the idea of being an actor was not in her sights. In fact, she was shy and dreaded being in front of audiences and her &quot;gripping performance&quot; did not change her disposition.  It wasn&apos;t until she performed a short skit in her high school social studies class where she realized she was on to something. Immediately after that class, the instructor encouraged Takara to register for her Drama class the next semester. She spent the remainder of her time in high school exploring the arts and discovered she had a knack for the performing arts.  Spending less than a year in the work force, after graduating college, Takara decided she would move to Atlanta, GA to try to make it as an actress. Since her move she has been blazing a trail through Atlanta&apos;s arts community in Film, Television, and Theatre. Most recently, the City of Atlanta awarded Takara the Emerging Artist Award in Media Arts.  In addition to acting, Takara is hard at work developing her production company and producing a web series she wrote.</biography>
