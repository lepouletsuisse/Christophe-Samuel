        <titre>Casino Royale</titre>
        <synopsis>Casino Royale introduces James Bond before he holds his license to kill. But Bond is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession, he is elevated to '00' status. Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Uganda where he is to spy on a terrorist, Mollaka. Not everything goes to plan and Bond decides to investigate, independently of MI6, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave danger together and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro, Bond allies himself with Mathis MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter who is representing the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.</synopsis>

          <nomNaissance>Green, Eva Ga√´lle</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>Eva Ga√´lle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a non-identical twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film _Au hasard Balthazar (1966)_ (qv). Her mother, 'Marl√®ne Jobert' (qv), is an actress who retired from acting and became a writer of children's books. Eva's mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva's father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University. She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: "La Jalousie en Trois Fax" and "Turcaret". There she caught the eye of director 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). During their work Bertolucci described Green as being "so beautiful it's indecent." Green won critical acclaim for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score. After The Dreamers Green's career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer _Ars√®ne Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite 'Romain Duris' (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite 'Orlando Bloom' (qv) and 'Liam Neeson' (qv) in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by 'Ridley Scott' (qv). The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in The Black Dahlia that went to 'Hilary Swank' (qv) because she didn't want to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead, Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite 'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl after 'Claudine Auger' (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv), 'Corinne Cl√©ry (I)' (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), 'Carole Bouquet' (qv) in _For Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and 'Sophie Marceau' (qv) in The World is not enough (1999). Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can't speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.</biographie>

          <nom>Craig, Daniel</nom>
          <nomNaissance>Craig, Daniel Wroughton</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces who was waiting tables as a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as "James Bond" in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv). He was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became landlord of "Ring O' Bells" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig, was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of "Oliver!", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club. At the age of 14, Craig played roles in "Oliver", "Romeo and Juliet" and "Cinderella" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as "Agamemnon" in Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv) and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes' (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named 'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial _"Our Friends in the North" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_ (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_ (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray "James Bond", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of 'Steven Spielberg' (qv). Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool "007". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as "Bond".</biographie>

After seven years in different repertory companies around the country he made his London debut in 1985 at the Notting Hill Gate Theatre in Arthur Schnitzler's play 'Anatole', which he describes as the first thing that got him noticed. Since then he has appeared with both the National and Royal Shakespeare companies and has taken on musical roles in the likes of 'Privates On Parade' and 'My Fair lady'.

          <nom>Sv√°tkov√°, Vlastina</nom>
          <biographie>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents: a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known in fact as "the hospital murderer". In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation of stories of one's line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.</biographie>

          <nom>Wright, Jeffrey</nom>
          <biographie>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation, Jeffrey Wright's undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business. Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990's Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996 in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright's harrowing performance as the late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the intensity of Wright's skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity of his skill.</biographie>

          <nom>Atkins, Lasco</nom>
          <biographie>Lasco Atkins was born in Hong Kong in 1980. At an early age he already knew he loved films, mainly action movies starring Arnie, Sly, JCVD, etc. Once at film school he learned a new appreciation for classics, black &amp; whites, 70s, etc. He re-watched old films such as Blade Runner and no longer thought of them as boring but as visual masterpieces. He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young DP's since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing, he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.</biographie>

        <titre>Django Unchained</titre>
        <synopsis>In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz meets the slave Django in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him. Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German. Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter, he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen is not easily fooled.</synopsis>

          <nom>Evermore, J.D.</nom>
          <biographie>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended 17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen Coe, Ray Price, and many others. After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker, and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play "Dylan's Ghost" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_. Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won an artist's print worth $80.</biographie>

          <biographie>Jamie's mother, Louise, was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed, his grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age 7 months, adopted him too. He says he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music in college. He released a music album in 1994, "Peep This" and sings the theme song for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _"Roc" (1991)_ (qv) and _"In Living Color" (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series. He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.</biographie>

          <nomNaissance>Jr., Walton Sanders Goggins</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>Walton Goggins received an Emmy¬Æ nomination and two Broadcast Television Journalists Association (BTJA) nominations for Best Supporting Actor for his role as 'Boyd Crowder' on FX's Peabody Award-winning Drama series Justified. Goggins reprised his turn as the transgender escort 'Venus Van Dam' (a play on his character Shane's alias of 'Cletus Van Damme' on The Shield) on the highly-rated FX drama series Sons of Anarchy. The role reunites Goggins with series creator Kurt Sutter who was also a writer on The Shield. Goggins completed production on writer/director William Monahan's Mojave with Garrett Hedlund and Oscar Issacs. He plays 'Jim,' an entertainment lawyer experiencing an existential crisis. He has also completed production on writer/director Ross Clarke's adaptation of Craig Clevenger's novel Dermaphoria. Goggins plays 'Eliah Blanc,' a wealthy New Orleanian whose pastimes include the funding of meth labs. Goggins has had pivotal roles in films by two of Hollywood's most important auteurs: Quentin Tarantino, in Django Unchained; and Steven Spielberg in Lincoln. He also appeared in such diverse films as G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, Robert Rodriguez's Predators and Machete Kills, Jon Favreau's Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and Rod Lurie's Straw Dogs. Goggins previously garnered much acclaim for his complex and edgy portrayal of 'Detective Shane Vendrell' on FX's gritty, award-winning drama series The Shield. In 2009, he was nominated for a Television Critics Association (TCA) Award in the category of "Individual Achievement in Drama." In the last ten years, Goggins has also taken his turn behind the camera. He recently collaborated with writer Adam Fierro ("The Shield") on the pilot "Gringo" which sold to FOX. Goggins' prior collaborations with his partners at Ginny Mule Pictures include winning an Academy Award¬Æ for their short film, The Accountant, which he produced and starred in. The team produced, directed and starred in their first feature, Chrystal, starring Billy Bob Thornton, which was accepted into the 2005 Sundance Film Festival's Dramatic Competition. For their third collaboration, Goggins produced and starred in the feature Randy and the Mob, which won the Audience Award for Best Feature at the 2007 Nashville Film Festival. Goggins and his Ginny Mule partners completed their fourth feature, That Evening Sun, starring Hal Holbrook and Goggins. The film made its world premiere at the South By Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin, TX in March 2009, where it won the Narrative Feature Audience Award and received the Special Jury Award for "Best Ensemble Cast." The film continued winning awards at over 14 film festivals, culminating with the honor of the "Wyatt Award" from the Southeastern Film Critics Association (SEFCA) and two Independent Spirit Award nominations. Goggins also takes time to lend a hand to various non-profit organizations and has joined forces with City Hearts, whose focus is bringing the arts to underfunded schools. He has also worked closely with Global Green USA, which is committed to sustainable development and the legislation to support it. He enjoys traveling the world and has spent time in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Central America, Morocco and India last spring. Goggins is an avid photographer and has captured many of his journeys on film.</biographie>

          <nom>Savini, Tom</nom>
          <biographie>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the "splatter movie" explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends 'Dick Smith (II)' (qv) and 'Rob Bottin' (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-'90s. Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor 'Lon Chaney' (qv), and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark of Chaney's career. In Savini's insightful book "Grande Illusions", he speaks of his early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using "spearmint gum", having misinterpreted that he was meant to actually use "spirit gum"! His first work was in low-budget fare, providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_ (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs with his grisly effects in the cult 'George A. Romero (I)' (qv)-directed zombie film _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned "splatter movie" genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow (1982)_ (qv) and Romero's third "Dead" film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which he won a Saturn Award). In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films, and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as "Morgan, the Black Knight" in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as "Blades", one of the biker gang members in _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as "Sex Machine", another leather-clad biker--but this time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv).</biographie>

          <biographie>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV series _"Miami Vice" (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined the 1980s. As James "Sonny" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps, prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from 1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer 'Michael Mann (I)' (qv), paired Johnson with the equally cool 'Philip Michael Thomas' (qv) as Det. Ricardo Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of 'Edward James Olmos' (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo. It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named "St. Vitus' Dance" with his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, "Miami Vice" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on "Miami Vice" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985. Johnson was born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled; the names of his first two wives have never been made public. 'Tippi Hedren' (qv), Johnson's co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her daughter 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was 22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s he lived with actress 'Patti D'Arbanville' (qv) and they had one son together. He remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for 'Antonio Banderas' (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have three children together. Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his career-high role on "Miami Vice", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith. He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the 'William Faulkner (I)' (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with 'Susan Sarandon' (qv). After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary filmmakers like 'John Frankenheimer' (qv), 'Sidney Lumet' (qv) and 'Dennis Hopper' (qv). After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _"Nash Bridges" (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well. It co-starred 'Cheech Marin' (qv) and 'Jodi Lyn O'Keefe' (qv). Johnson played the title role, a captain in the San Francisco PD's Special Investigations Unit. He was again paired with a flashy vehicle, this time an electric-yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda convertible. After "Nash Bridges" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom drama _"Just Legal" (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv), and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange flate ball√¶r II (2008)_ (qv) and the Italian films _Bastardi (2008)_ (qv) and _Torno a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in Rome (2010)_ (qv) with 'Anjelica Huston' (qv) and 'Danny DeVito' (qv), as well as the indie comedy _A Good Old Fashioned Orgy (2011)_ (qv). 'Don Johnson (I)' starred in the 2007 feature film, _"Moondance Alexander" (2007)_, along with 'Lori Loughlin' (qv), 'Kay Panabaker' (qv), 'James Best (I)' (qv), 'Sasha Cohen (I)' (qv), and 'Whitney Sloan' (qv).</biographie>

          <nomNaissance>Russo, James Vincent</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, "The Candy Store", while attending college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down one's back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly, Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable "tough guy" performer he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role in "Extremities" on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which he terrorized 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be. Other decent roles in films include 'Kevin Costner' (qv)'s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv) and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We're No Angels (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has "Welcome to Andromeda", "Deathwatch", "Marat/Sade" and the afore-mentioned "Extremities" to his credit. Russo appeared opposite 'Johnny Depp' (qv) in 'Roman Polanski' (qv)'s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed mobster "Victor Mura" in TV's short-lived, _"Falcone" (2000)_ (qv), the following year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in _Stealing Sinatra (2003)_ (qv).</biographie>

          <nom>Bell, Zo√´</nom>
          <biographie>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) and 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk them. Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for Uma Thurman's role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol. 1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle Barry's _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv). Bell's talent can not only be seen on the big screen but also in the cult television series _"Xena: Warrior Princess" (1995)_ (qv) where she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC thriller _"Alias" (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double for Vicki Pratti. In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell along with legendary stunt-woman 'Jeannie Epper' (qv) give an insight into the career of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated career. Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes to someday own a home in New Zealand.</biographie>

          <biographie>Franco Nero, a leading actor in international cinema, was born in Parma (Northern Italy). His inclination for acting had already become obvious in his teenage years when he began organizing and participating in student plays. After a short stint at a leading theater school, he moved to Rome where he joined a small group of friends for the purpose of making some documentaries. Still unsure of his ultimate vocation, he worked various jobs on the crew. The role as Abel in John Houston's film "The Bible" marked a crucial point in his career. A few months later he had his big break with the internationally acclaimed cult-classic Spaghetti-Western "Django". The following year Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of "Camelot" (Warner Bros.), opposite Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award. Nero has appeared in more than 195 movies around the world and has worked with Europe's top directors, such as Luis Bunuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, Sergei Bondarciuk, Michael Cacoyannis, Elio Petri, Marco Bellocchio, Enzo G. Castellari, just to mention a few. He has also payed the roles of leading national heroes, such as "Garibaldi" (Italy), "Arpad" (Hungary", "Banovic Strahinja" (Yugoslavia). In the USA he has been in successful mini-series such as "The Pirate" (Warner Bros), "The Last Days of Pompeii" (CBS), "Young Catherine" (TNT), "Bella Mafia" (CBS), "The Painted Lady", "Saint Augustine", and movies such as "The Legend of Valentino", "21 Hours to Munich", "Force 10 from Navarone", "Enter the Ninja", "The Versace Murder", "Die Hard 2", and recently "Letters to Juliet". At the beginning of the 80's, he also began producing, writing and directing. Between films, he participates in various theatrical events. Over the last 45 years he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli. He has received many awards and in 1992 for his artistic merits a knighthood of the Italian Republic was bestowed on him by the President of Italy. In 2011 he was honored by Brunel University of London with the honorary degree of doctor of Letters honoris causa and in Toronto with a star on the walk of fame.</biographie>

          <biographie>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular radio disc jockey on Chicago's number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment instead. While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970's based major motion picture, "American Gangster." Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time, Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70's style afro and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson's eyes and the hairstyle befitting of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, "Common Sense." With the successful major motion picture, "American Gangster" under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was "Django Unchained," and the role was that of the character named, "Blueberry," a slave turned killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861.

          <biographie>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival, by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner 'Roger Avary' (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with friends and fellow auteurs 'Alexandre Rockwell' (qv), 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv) and 'Allison Anders' (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with 'George Clooney' (qv). The film did fairly well theatrically.</biographie>

          <biographie>Christoph Waltz was born to Elisabeth Urbancic, a costume designer, and Johannes Waltz, a stage builder. He has 3 siblings. He was born into a theater family. His grandmother was the Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. Christoph attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London. During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however, attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting. For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner. It was not until he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar, Academy Award winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award. Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His partner is the costume builder Judith Holste.</biographie>

          <nom>Allen, Todd</nom>
          <biographie>Actor/writer/producer Todd Allen counts 'Gregory Peck' (qv), 'Marlon Brando' (qv), 'Steve McQueen (I)' (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and 'Robert Mitchum' (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor. Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television. He is filming the inspirational sports drama, "My All American" written and directed by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster Django Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer named, "Dollar Bill." In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _"Friday Night Lights" (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with 'Robert Duvall' (qv) in Duvall's Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred with Duvall again in AMC's Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _"Broken Trail" (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of "Marshal Bill Miller," a man who carries severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan. Other career highlights include three films with 'Lawrence Kasdan' (qv), three films with 'Kevin Costner' (qv), and playing fighter ace 'Chuck Yeager' (qv) in a Hallmark Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television, including appearances on _"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (2000)_ (qv), _"NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service" (2003)_ (qv), _"Monk" (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv). Allen will launch an independent media and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay, a gritty, film-noir styled Western, "The Deserters", was the subject of much competition among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn't have to do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, "Suicide Grip," a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. "The Empty Quarter," is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well in Saudi Arabia's most barren desert and "Rio Grande" is based on the best selling memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger along the volatile Texas/Mexico border. Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.</biographie>

          <biographie>Nichole Galicia is a film and television actress whose journey to the big screen began as a high fashion model on the catwalks of Europe and New York. Most recently, acclaimed director Quentin Tarantino hand picked Galicia for his film, Django Unchained, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Foxx. Galicia has garnered much buzz around the character she plays "Sheba," DiCaprio's love interest and since, she has been extremely well received in the fashion industry, with her photos running in Page Six, W and online fashion sites, noting her exceptional taste in clothing, versatile hairstyles among other trending aspects of her looks. Born in Panama and raised in New York, Galicia focused on her brains, not beauty. Nevertheless by high school, this girl with a 183 IQ, had rapidly evolved into a striking and vivacious young woman inexorably caught up in the highly competitive fashion industry. To date, Galicia's modeling credits include ad campaigns for: The Gap, Pepsi, Neutrogena and Hanes. Additionally, her unique face has graced the pages of GQ, Vogue and Elle magazines. Recently she was in an edgy shoot for W magazine with Tarantino promoting their film. After conquering the modeling world, Galicia discovered a new passion in acting. She starred alongside Cuba Gooding Jr, Hill Harper and Oliver Platt, to name a few When Galicia is not modeling or acting she devotes her time to charities focused on developing the esteem and confidence of youth. Nichole actively serves on the board of the Junior Committee of the New York Center for Children; a charity dedicated to raising awareness and fighting child abuse. As a sports fan, Galicia enjoys the power and fury of Formula One Racing. Even more fascinating however is Nichole's taste for art. Her favorite artist is Diego Velazquez and favorite museum is the Prado in Madrid. In fact, she owns dozens of engravings and serigraphs, a few of which appear in a book she wrote called "Equipo Cronica: The Nichole Kent Collection." It is named as such, as she sourced all of the works with the help of her mentor Kent Alessandro. Nichole owns all of the Equipo Cronica works discussed in the book. In her spare time, she visits art galleries, the web and private collections looking for new Equipo Cronicas. She maintains a residence in Madrid, New York and Los Angeles.</biographie>

          <nomNaissance>Tamblyn, Russell Irving</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>Russ Tamblyn might as well face it...he will be a Jet "till his last dying day." Indelibly linked to the "womb to tomb" role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story (1961)_ (qv), it's not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed the teenage troublemaker who became the '50s equivalent of the Mercutio character in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation. To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles, California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age ten by actor 'Lloyd Bridges (I)' (qv) for the play "Stone Jungle", Russ was soon performing on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as "Rusty Tamblyn" then, the tousle-haired scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_ (qv) starring another child actor, 'Dean Stockwell' (qv). Having taken up dancing and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first TV appearance on the "The Ed Sullivan Show." Eventually handed a starring role in the "B" film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father's Little Dividend (1951)_ (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_ (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in one of MGM's best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn's timing was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with 'Lana Turner' (qv), 'Arthur Kennedy (I)' (qv), 'Hope Lange' (qv) and 'Diane Varsi' (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers started dwindling. Tamblyn's last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with 'Julie Harris (I)' (qv) and 'Claire Bloom (I)' (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring 'Richard Widmark' (qv) and 'Sidney Poitier' (qv). After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_ (qv), _Satan's Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical "Cabaret," Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn't on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _"Twin Peaks" (1990)_ (qv), it was the first time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic duties and the managing of actress/daughter 'Amber Tamblyn' (qv)'s career, she of _"Joan of Arcadia" (2003)_ (qv) fame.</biographie>

          <nom>Dern, Bruce</nom>
          <nomNaissance>Dern, Bruce MacLeish</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies' premier heavy, playing sociopaths, psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe, repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that casting directors capitalized on. 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), a close friend, claimed that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and a secretary of war under 'Franklin D. Roosevelt' (qv). When allowed to step out of his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well. Some critics said that "Gatsby" would have been better if Dern rather than 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv) had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson's brother in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in "Coming Home," a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for the role, then fell victim to the infamous "Oscar curse" that has claimed other winners, most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner 'Gig Young' (qv), Dern's co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969)_ (qv). Dern, like Young before him, was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho, surpassing even 'Anthony Perkins (I)' (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before "Coming Home." He failed, and his career suffered. Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3 (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv), flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star 'Maud Adams' (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern's star was seriously dimmed. Although he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of 'Jason Miller (I)' (qv)'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering. Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, 'Diane Ladd' (qv), and their daughter, 'Laura Dern' (qv), kicked into high gear. Since the 1990 high point of the second wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema's premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) in _The Cowboys (1972)_ (qv), Dern's career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor's artistic development as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom, trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.</biographie>

          <nomNaissance>Wopat, Thomas S.</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>He'll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol' boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed, dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking 'John Schneider (I)' (qv) was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s series _"The Dukes of Hazzard" (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows. The highly engaging Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951. Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as "South Pacific", "West Side Story" and "Jesus Christ Superstar". Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical "I Love My Wife", other book shows came his way including "The Robber Bridegroom" and the lead in "Oklahoma!" With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn't take long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons, although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn't the same without them and they eventually were brought back. During the show's run, Tom kick-started his recording career with his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs. After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv)' ex-husband/stuntman on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills. He returned with commanding baritone leads in "Carousel" (1986), "City of Angels" (1990) and "Guys and Dolls" (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting Frank Butler role opposite 'Bernadette Peters' (qv) in the popular Broadway revival of "Annie Get Your Gun" and earned a Tony nomination in the process. It's only gotten sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras in programs featuring Broadway's finest music, he has continued on the New York stage with successive roles in "42nd Street" and "Chicago" (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn). In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for "Best Revival of a Play") production of "Glengarry Glen Ross" starring acting heavyweights 'Alan Alda' (qv) and 'Liev Schreiber' (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national "Over The Rainbow" tour with 'Faith Prince' (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of 'Harold Arlen' (qv), a tour that included Carnegie Hall.</biographie>

          <nom>DiCaprio, Leonardo</nom>
          <nomNaissance>DiCaprio, Leonardo Wilhelm</nomNaissance>
          <biographie>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv). But such a rich, varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring as DiCaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist 'George DiCaprio (I)' (qv) and 'Irmelin DiCaprio' (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo's father, George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. However, Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name "Lenny Williams", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs. DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles in a number of television series, such as _"Roseanne" (1988)_ (qv) and _"The New Lassie" (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie. While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the "Cousin Oliver" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, "Jim Carroll", in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late 'River Phoenix' (qv) originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as "Romeo" in 'Baz Luhrmann' (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_ (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director 'Martin Scorsese' (qv). With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any clich√© about actors. DiCaprio is not merely a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring and challenging actors working today.</biographie>

He continued to hone his acting skills by taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy's family members were victims of Hurricane Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate.

He gave me legs until I was able to run" In 2012, Lundy made his major motion picture debut as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western, Django Unchained. Lundy's role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting. Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.</biographie>

          <biographie>Dana Gourrier (pronounced Gu-Ree-A) is a native of New Orleans with ancestry dating back 7 generations. Since 8 years old she has been in front of audiences performing: be it singing, dancing, or acting. Her true love of theater began when she was 14 years old at the New Orleans Recreational Department Theater under the program's long-time, late director, Ty Tracy. After receiving her BFA in Performance Art from UL Lafayette, she went to New York in higher pursuits. She continued her studies participating in a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw Shakespeare in the Park's Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York.

Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood's biggest Academy Award Winners and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained.
