      <h2>Synopsis</h2>Casino Royale introduces James Bond before he holds his license to kill. But Bond
      is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession,
      he is elevated to '00' status. Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Uganda where
      he is to spy on a terrorist, Mollaka. Not everything goes to plan and Bond decides
      to investigate, independently of MI6, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist
      cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend,
      Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's
      terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning
      to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6
      assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy
      his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd.
      At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens
      as they brave danger together and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro,
      Bond allies himself with Mathis MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter who is representing
      the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence,
      raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.

                     							Biographie :<br>Daniel Craig, one of British theatre's most famous faces who was waiting tables as
                     a struggling teenage actor with the NYT, went on to star as "James Bond" in _Casino
                     Royale (2006)_ (qv), _Quantum of Solace (2008)_ (qv) and _Skyfall (2012)_ (qv). He
                     was born Daniel Wroughton Craig on March 2, 1968, at 41 Liverpool Road, Chester, Cheshire,
                     England. His father, Tim Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, then became
                     landlord of "Ring O' Bells" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia Craig,
                     was an art teacher. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel Craig was raised
                     with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of
                     his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman
                     Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school
                     plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of "Oliver!", and
                     his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie
                     he ever saw at the cinema was 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv)'s _Live and Let Die (1973)_ (qv);
                     young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart.
                     He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club. At the age
                     of 14, Craig played roles in "Oliver", "Romeo and Juliet" and "Cinderella" at Hilbre
                     High School in West Kirby, Wirral, UK. He left Hilbre High at 16 to audition at the
                     National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was
                     accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage
                     debut as "Agamemnon" in Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida". As a struggling actor
                     with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed
                     with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership
                     of director 'Edward Wilson (I)' (qv). He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall,
                     but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School
                     of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside 'Ewan McGregor' (qv)
                     and 'Alistair McGowan' (qv), then later 'Damian Lewis (I)' (qv) and 'Joseph Fiennes'
                     (qv), among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage
                     of 'Colin McCormack (I)' (qv), the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From
                     1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named
                     'Ella Craig' (qv), was born in 1992. Daniel Craig made his film debut in _The Power
                     of One (1992)_ (qv). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial
                     _"Our Friends in the North" (1996)_ (qv). He shot to international fame after playing
                     supporting roles in _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)_ (qv) and _Road to Perdition (2002)_
                     (qv). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in _Layer Cake (2004)_
                     (qv), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor
                     to portray "James Bond", in October of 2005, weeks after he finished his work in _Munich
                     (2005)_ (qv), where he co-starred with 'Eric Bana' (qv) under the directorship of
                     'Steven Spielberg' (qv). Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet
                     milieu makes him a cool "007". He is the first blonde actor to play Bond, and also
                     the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be
                     born after the death of author 'Ian Fleming (I)' (qv) in 1964. Four of the past Bond
                     actors: 'Sean Connery' (qv), 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), 'Timothy Dalton' (qv) and 'Pierce
                     Brosnan' (qv) have indicated that Craig is a good choice as "Bond".</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a non-identical
                     twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film
                     _Au hasard Balthazar (1966)_ (qv). Her mother, 'Marlène Jobert' (qv), is an actress
                     who retired from acting and became a writer of children's books. Eva's mother was
                     born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of
                     France), and Eva's father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school
                     at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School
                     in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for
                     three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic
                     Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York
                     University. She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on
                     stage in several theater productions: "La Jalousie en Trois Fax" and "Turcaret". There
                     she caught the eye of director 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). Green followed a recommendation
                     to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing
                     _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv) with 'Bernardo Bertolucci' (qv). During their work Bertolucci
                     described Green as being "so beautiful it's indecent." Green won critical acclaim
                     for her role in _The Dreamers (2003)_ (qv). She also attracted a great deal of attention
                     from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides
                     her work as an actress Green also composed original music and recorded several sound
                     tracks for the film score. After The Dreamers Green's career ascended to the level
                     where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest
                     of cult French gentleman stealer _Arsène Lupin (2004)_ (qv) opposite 'Romain Duris'
                     (qv). In 2005 she co-starred opposite 'Orlando Bloom' (qv) and 'Liam Neeson' (qv)
                     in _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) produced and directed by 'Ridley Scott' (qv). The
                     film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale
                     role in The Black Dahlia that went to 'Hilary Swank' (qv) because she didn't want
                     to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in The Dreamers. Instead,
                     Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of Vesper Lynd, one of three Bond girls, opposite
                     'Daniel Craig (I)' (qv) in _Casino Royale (2006)_ (qv) and became the 5th French actress
                     to play a James Bond girl after 'Claudine Auger' (qv) in _Thunderball (1965)_ (qv),
                     'Corinne Cléry (I)' (qv) in _Moonraker (1979)_ (qv), 'Carole Bouquet' (qv) in _For
                     Your Eyes Only (1981)_ (qv) and 'Sophie Marceau' (qv) in The World is not enough (1999).
                     Since her school years Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural
                     person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she
                     and her twin sister can't speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond
                     her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor.
                     Her other activities outside of acting include playing and composing music, cooking
                     at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two
                     residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>Quite possibly the most underrated and underexposed actor of his caliber and generation,
                     Jeffrey Wright's undeniable talent and ability to successfully bring to life any role
                     he undertakes is on a par with the most praised and revered A-list actors in the business.
                     Born and raised in Washington DC, Wright graduated from the prestigious Amherst college
                     in 1987. Although he studied Political Science while at Amherst, Wright left the school
                     with something that would prove to be more valuable: a love for acting. Shortly after
                     graduating he won an acting scholarship to NYU, but dropped out after only two months
                     to pursue acting full time. With roles in 1990's Presumed Innocent, and the Broadway
                     production of Angels in America, (in which he won a well deserved Tony award), within
                     a relatively short time Wright was able to show off his exceptional talent and ability
                     on both stage and screen alike. His first major on-screen performance came in 1996
                     in the Julian Schnabel directed film Basquiat. Wright's harrowing performance as the
                     late painter Jean Michele Basquiat was critically acclaimed for its haunting accuracy
                     and raw emotion. With a Tony, a Golden Globe, and an AFI award under his belt, the
                     intensity of Wright's skill has been proven over and over again. Hopefully the near
                     future will bring an influx of more varied lead roles for black actors so that Wright
                     can continue to astonish his colleagues, critics and fans alike with the intensity
                     of his skill.</span></td>

                     dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films
                     as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects. He was born August
                     1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For ten years young Giannini lived and studied in Naples,
                     earning his degree in electronics. At the age of 18 he enrolled in the Academy of
                     Dramatic Art D'Amico in Rome, making his stage acting debut there. His credits included
                     performances in contemporary Italian plays, as well, as in Italian productions of
                     'William Shakespeare (I)' (qv)'s plays "Romeo and Juliet" and "A Midsummer's Night
                     Dream". In 1965 he made his debut on television starring as David Copperfield in the
                     TV mini-series made by RAI, the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen
                     debut in _Libido (1965)_ (qv), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has
                     been in a successful collaboration with the legendary Italian director 'Lina Wertmüller'
                     (qv), who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears

                     da un insolito destino nell'azzurro mare d'agosto (1974)_ (qv) and as a survivor of
                     a concentration camp in the Oscar-nominated _Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975)_ (qv).
                     He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in 'Rainer Werner Fassbinder'
                     (qv)'s masterpiece _Lili Marleen (1981)_ (qv). Giannini also made a reputation for
                     dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as 'Jack

                     (qv), 'Gérard Depardieu' (qv) and 'Ian McKellen' (qv), among others. He received a

                     (qv). Giannini's fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a
                     number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as _A Walk in the Clouds
                     (1995)_ (qv), _Hannibal (2001)_ (qv), _Darkness (2002)_ (qv) and _Man on Fire (2004)_
                     (qv), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film _Casino

                     							Biographie :<br>Ivana Milicevic was born on April 26, 1974, in Sarajevo, Bosnia (part of Yugoslavia
                     at that time), into an ethnic Croatian family of Tonka and Damir Milicevic. Ivana
                     has a younger brother, Tomo Milicevic. The family emigrated to the United States,
                     and young Ivana Milicevic was raised in Michigan. She attended Athens High school
                     in Troy, Michigan, and worked as a model during her school years. She became a naturalized
                     citizen of the United States. In 1992, Milicevic graduated from high school and moved
                     to Los Angeles in pursuit of an acting career. She was a struggling stand-up comedienne,
                     trying to win over crowds with her stories of the modeling business. In 1996, she
                     made her film debut under the name Ivana Marina with a one-line role as a Former Girlfriend
                     of 'Tom Cruise' (qv) in _Jerry Maguire (1996)_ (qv). In 1997, she followed up with
                     a guest role on NBC's _"Seinfeld" (1989)_ (qv) and made guest appearances on several
                     other television shows. She played bit parts in _Vanilla Sky (2001)_ (qv) and _Love
                     Actually (2003)_ (qv), among her many other cameo appearances. Milicevic capitalized
                     on her experience as a comedienne in a supporting role as Russian model Roxana Milla
                     Slasnikova in the romantic comedy _Head Over Heels (2001)_ (qv). She appeared as a
                     lookalike of 'Uma Thurman' (qv) opposite 'Ben Affleck' (qv), trying to fool him into
                     thinking she is Uma, in _Paycheck (2003)_ (qv). In a departure from her one-dimensional
                     roles, Milicevic showed her dramatic talent in a supporting role as Milla Yugorsky
                     in a dark and gritty drama _Running Scared (2006)_ (qv). In 2006, she started a recurring
                     role on the CBS TV series _"Love Monkey" (2006)_ (qv). In 2006, Milicevic made a big
                     step forward in her career appearing as Valenka, one of three Bond girls in _Casino
                     Royale (2006)_ (qv), for which she did most of her scenes on locations in Prague and
                     in London. She is currently residing in Los Angeles, California.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>Ten years before Czechoslovakia separated, Vlastina was born to Czechoslovakian parents:
                     a Slovak mother and Czech (or shall we say, Moravian) father. She attended elementary
                     and a high school in the Slovak town of Myjava. She studied piano for fifteen years
                     and also took in drawings and singing lessons. She also studied writing and reciting
                     poems. Even though Vlastina had wanted become an actress since childhood, she made
                     two detours along the way. She studied Mass Communication as well as the Commenius
                     University in Bratislava, where she got her Master. Her first feature was Casino Royale
                     by Martin Campbell, where she got a part in the casino. Then she continued in The
                     Red Baron, Dark Spirits, Women in Temptation. She got a role of an American spy in
                     television film The Rhythm at their heels. A story set in the early 1950s, when the
                     communist regime in Czechoslovakia mercilessly wiped out the remaining elements of
                     the free world. A bunch of naive young people associated with a coffee-house jazz
                     band were easy prey for the pitiless State Security men. In 2009 she got a part of
                     a nurse Tereza in thriller Unknown Hour - a not very fictive story of a man, known
                     in fact as "the hospital murderer". In 2010 she started to shoot a historical epic
                     The Danube Saga where she performed the main character of Elena Unger. Saga, a concatenation
                     of stories of one's line. Vlastina is also performing in theater and writing books.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>Lasco Atkins was born in Hong Kong in 1980. At an early age he already knew he loved
                     films, mainly action movies starring Arnie, Sly, JCVD, etc. Once at film school he
                     learned a new appreciation for classics, black &amp; whites, 70s, etc. He re-watched old
                     films such as Blade Runner and no longer thought of them as boring but as visual masterpieces.
                     He started making videos of skits with friends and skateboarding videos. At Art College
                     (Surrey Institute in Farnham) he tried video editing for the first time, where he
                     mainly made OTT videos. At Film School he shot on film stock for the first time and
                     edited on Steen-beck also. He developed a wider understanding and appreciation for
                     how films were/are made. Going in only wanting to be a director, he came out of LFS
                     (London Film School) as a cameraman. Once he left film school, he began focus pulling/camera
                     assistant. Eventually he caught the lighting bug. This is extremely helpful for young
                     DP's since they must have a good knowledge of lights and camera. Occasionally directing,
                     he also acts on bigger budget films. He is happy anywhere on a film set, either in
                     front, behind or anywhere as long as the project is valuable and an experience. Lately
                     he has even tried his hands at rapping, appearing in two of his own music videos this
                     year already (2013) known as Lasco Tobasco.</span></td>
