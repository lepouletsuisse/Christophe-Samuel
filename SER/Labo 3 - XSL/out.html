Casino Royale
Casino Royale introduces James Bond before he holds his license to kill. But Bond
is no less dangerous, and with two professional assassinations in quick succession,
he is elevated to '00' status. Bond's first 007 mission takes him to Uganda where
he is to spy on a terrorist, Mollaka. Not everything goes to plan and Bond decides
to investigate, independently of MI6, in order to track down the rest of the terrorist
cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend,
Solange. He learns that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the world's
terrorist organizations. Secret Service intelligence reveals that Le Chiffre is planning
to raise money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6
assigns 007 to play against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy
his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the beguiling Vesper Lynd.
At first skeptical of what value Vesper can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens
as they brave danger together and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. In Montenegro,
Bond allies himself with Mathis MI6's local field agent, and Felix Leiter who is representing
the interests of the CIA. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence,
raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying climax.

GoldenEye
1986 - Soviet Russia has been arming international terrorists with chemical weapon
technology, and a chemical weapons plant in the mountains is the target of James Bond
and his closest compatriot, Alec Trevelyan. Infiltrating the compound, they are spotted
and Alec is captured. When a ruthless Soviet officer, Oromov, executes Trevelyan,
James pulls off a spectacular escape and succeeds in blowing up the compound. Now
in 1995, he is assigned to tail former Red Air Force jet jockey Xenia Onatopp, who
is working for a Russian crime syndicate known as Janus, but he is unable to stop
her from stealing a powerful helicopter - a theft initially dismissed as a possibility
by MI6's new leader, a woman who is a bureaucratic bean counter who, despite her acidic
responses to grumbling from her ticked-off men, is having to learn her job as she
goes, and who has to trust James Bond's instincts after a nuclear accident occurs
over a Russian region housing the tracking station for a weapons satellite known as
Goldeneye. James must track down the stolen gunship and all leads to a second Goldeneye
system, and along the way he is horrified to find the true identity of the Janus syndicate,
which leads to a spectacular running pursuit from the stolen gunship through a Soviet
army prison to a wild street chase involving a tank and confrontation with a Soviet
missile train, and eventually a showdown in the jungles of Cuba.
