      <h2>Synopsis</h2>In 1858, in Texas, the former German dentist Dr. King Schultz meets the slave Django
      in a lonely road while being transported by the slavers Speck Brothers. He asks if
      Django knows the Brittle Brothers and with the affirmative, he buys Django for him.
      Then Dr. Schultz tells that he is a bounty hunter chasing John, Ellis and Roger Brittle
      and proposes a deal to Django: if he helps him, he would give his freedom, a horse
      and US$ 75.00 for him. Django accepts the deal and Dr. Schultz trains him to be his
      deputy. They kill the brothers in Daughtray and Django tells that he would use the
      money to buy the freedom of his wife Broomhilda, who is a slave that speaks German.
      Dr. Schultz proposes another deal to Django: if he teams-up with him during the winter,
      he would give one-third of the rewards and help him to rescue Broomhilda. Django accepts
      his new deal and they become friends. After the winter, Dr. Schultz goes to Gatlinburgh
      and learns that Broomhilda was sold to the ruthless Calvin Candie von Shaft, who lives
      in the Candyland Farm, in Mississippi. Dr. Schultz plots a scheme with Django to lure
      Calvin and rescue Broomhilda from him. But his cruel minion Stephen is not easily
      fooled.

                     							Biographie :<br>Jamie's mother, Louise, was an adopted child. When her marriage to his father failed,
                     his grandparents, Mark and Estelle Talley, stepped in and, at age 7 months, adopted
                     him too. He says he had a very rigid upbringing that placed him in the Boy Scouts
                     and the church choir. During high school, he played quarterback for his high school
                     team and was good enough that he got press in Dallas newspapers. He studied music
                     in college. He released a music album in 1994, "Peep This" and sings the theme song
                     for his 1999 movie, _Any Given Sunday (1999)_ (qv). However, in 1989, his life changed
                     when a girl friend challenged him to get up onstage at the Comedy Club. In fact, he
                     says he took his androgynous stage name because he learned that women got preference
                     for mike time on open stage nights. That led to his being cast in _"Roc" (1991)_ (qv)
                     and _"In Living Color" (1990)_ (qv) and ultimately to his own WB network TV series.
                     He has a daughter, Corrine, born in 1995, who lives with her mother.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>Christoph Waltz was born to Elisabeth Urbancic, a costume designer, and Johannes Waltz,
                     a stage builder. He has 3 siblings. He was born into a theater family. His grandmother
                     was the Viennese Burgtheater actress Maria Mayen, and his step-grandfather was fellow
                     Burgtheater actor Emmerich Reimers. Christoph attended the Theresianium and Billrothstrasse
                     in Vienna. Upon graduation, he attended the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar before going to
                     New York to the Lee Strasberg Institute. While in New York, Christoph met his first
                     wife, and moved back to Vienna, then to London. During the 80s, Christoph worked primarily
                     in theater, commuting from his home in London to Germany. Slowly he began to work
                     in TV, taking one-off roles on series, and TV movies. Film roles soon followed, however,
                     attempts to break into English-speaking film and TV were unsuccessful. Christoph has
                     stated he is grateful to have made a living and supported his family through acting.
                     For thirty years he worked steadily, tirelessly, in this manner. It was not until
                     he met Quentin Tarantino that his career in Hollywood took off. The role of Colonel
                     Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in
                     German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar, Academy Award winning
                     actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix
                     d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and
                     the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award. Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles.

                     							Biographie :<br>Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's.
                     DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of
                     the sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_ (qv) and low budget horror movies, such as _Critters
                     3 (1991)_ (qv), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor
                     in movies such as _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) and _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), to then
                     become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors
                     such as 'Martin Scorsese' (qv) and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv). But such a rich,
                     varied career is what you would expect from someone who has had such an unusual upbring
                     as DiCaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio is the only child of former comic book artist 'George
                     DiCaprio (I)' (qv) and 'Irmelin DiCaprio' (qv) (both born 1943). Leonardo's father,
                     George, had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book
                     titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical
                     comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. However, Leonardo's
                     performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up
                     with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name "Lenny Williams",
                     DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.
                     DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in bit part roles
                     in a number of television series, such as _"Roseanne" (1988)_ (qv) and _"The New Lassie"
                     (1989)_ (qv), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in _Critters
                     3 (1991)_ (qv), a low-budget horror movie. While _Critters 3 (1991)_ (qv) did little
                     to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel,
                     and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom _"Growing Pains" (1985)_
                     (qv), in which Leonardo was cast in the "Cousin Oliver" role of a young homeless boy
                     who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on _"Growing Pains" (1985)_
                     (qv) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring
                     DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the show ended, DiCaprio began auditioning
                     for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops. Leonardo took
                     up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth
                     in _What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)_ (qv), a young gunslinger in _The Quick and
                     the Dead (1995)_ (qv) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date,
                     "Jim Carroll", in _The Basketball Diaries (1995)_ (qv), a role which the late 'River
                     Phoenix' (qv) originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish
                     Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as "Romeo" in 'Baz Luhrmann'
                     (qv)'s _Romeo + Juliet (1996)_ (qv) that Leonardo became a household name, a true
                     movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers,
                     _Titanic (1997)_ (qv), which went on to beat all box office records held before then,
                     as, at the time, _Titanic (1997)_ (qv) became the highest grossing movie of all time,
                     and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on _Titanic
                     (1997)_ (qv), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in _The
                     Man in the Iron Mask (1998/I)_ (qv) and the low-budget _The Beach (2000/I)_ (qv) being
                     some of his few notable roles during this period. However, in 2002, he burst back
                     into screens throughout the world with leading roles in _Catch Me If You Can (2002)_
                     (qv) and _Gangs of New York (2002)_ (qv), his first of many collaborations with director
                     'Martin Scorsese' (qv). With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is
                     now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional
                     career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who
                     is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue
                     led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the
                     natural environment. As someone who has gone from bit parts in television commercials
                     to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most
                     diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continues to defy conventions about the types
                     of roles he will accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all star casts
                     in action thrillers such as _The Departed (2006)_ (qv), _Shutter Island (2010)_ (qv)
                     and 'Christopher Nolan (I)' (qv)'s _Inception (2010)_ (qv), DiCaprio continues to
                     wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors. DiCaprio is not merely
                     a former teen heartthrob turned leading man, he is one of the most respected, daring
                     and challenging actors working today.</span></td>

                     Association (BTJA) nominations for Best Supporting Actor for his role as 'Boyd Crowder'
                     on FX's Peabody Award-winning Drama series Justified. Goggins reprised his turn as
                     the transgender escort 'Venus Van Dam' (a play on his character Shane's alias of 'Cletus
                     Van Damme' on The Shield) on the highly-rated FX drama series Sons of Anarchy. The
                     role reunites Goggins with series creator Kurt Sutter who was also a writer on The
                     Shield. Goggins completed production on writer/director William Monahan's Mojave with
                     Garrett Hedlund and Oscar Issacs. He plays 'Jim,' an entertainment lawyer experiencing
                     an existential crisis. He has also completed production on writer/director Ross Clarke's
                     adaptation of Craig Clevenger's novel Dermaphoria. Goggins plays 'Eliah Blanc,' a
                     wealthy New Orleanian whose pastimes include the funding of meth labs. Goggins has
                     had pivotal roles in films by two of Hollywood's most important auteurs: Quentin Tarantino,
                     in Django Unchained; and Steven Spielberg in Lincoln. He also appeared in such diverse
                     films as G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, Robert Rodriguez's Predators and Machete Kills,
                     Jon Favreau's Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and Rod Lurie's Straw Dogs. Goggins previously garnered
                     much acclaim for his complex and edgy portrayal of 'Detective Shane Vendrell' on FX's
                     gritty, award-winning drama series The Shield. In 2009, he was nominated for a Television
                     Critics Association (TCA) Award in the category of "Individual Achievement in Drama."
                     In the last ten years, Goggins has also taken his turn behind the camera. He recently
                     collaborated with writer Adam Fierro ("The Shield") on the pilot "Gringo" which sold
                     to FOX. Goggins' prior collaborations with his partners at Ginny Mule Pictures include
                     winning an Academy Award® for their short film, The Accountant, which he produced
                     and starred in. The team produced, directed and starred in their first feature, Chrystal,
                     starring Billy Bob Thornton, which was accepted into the 2005 Sundance Film Festival's
                     Dramatic Competition. For their third collaboration, Goggins produced and starred
                     in the feature Randy and the Mob, which won the Audience Award for Best Feature at
                     the 2007 Nashville Film Festival. Goggins and his Ginny Mule partners completed their
                     fourth feature, That Evening Sun, starring Hal Holbrook and Goggins. The film made
                     its world premiere at the South By Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin, TX in
                     March 2009, where it won the Narrative Feature Audience Award and received the Special
                     Jury Award for "Best Ensemble Cast." The film continued winning awards at over 14
                     film festivals, culminating with the honor of the "Wyatt Award" from the Southeastern
                     Film Critics Association (SEFCA) and two Independent Spirit Award nominations. Goggins
                     also takes time to lend a hand to various non-profit organizations and has joined
                     forces with City Hearts, whose focus is bringing the arts to underfunded schools.
                     He has also worked closely with Global Green USA, which is committed to sustainable
                     development and the legislation to support it. He enjoys traveling the world and has
                     spent time in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Central America, Morocco and India last
                     spring. Goggins is an avid photographer and has captured many of his journeys on film.</span></td>

                     (qv). That same year he garnered acclaim on Broadway with 'Richard Gere' (qv) in the
                     concentration camp drama "Bent". In a career spanning nearly four decades, James has
                     run the gamut of roles and solid career choices. Ranging from the psychopaths, 'Dutch
                     Schultz' (qv) in 'Francis Copolla''s _The Cotton Club (1984)_ (qv) and 'Albert Ganz'
                     in Walter Hill's _48 Hrs. (1982)_ (qv) to Samantha's lover, the billionaire playboy,

                     garnered roles which highlight a more vulnerable side, such as his guitarist who gets
                     a break in the Oscar-winning short, _Session Man (1991) (TV)_ (qv) or his artist who

                     as Karev's long-lost Dad. While remaining active with top feature films James enjoys

                     in Quentin Tarintino's smash hit Django Unchained. James won the 8th annual SAG award
                     as a member of the Outstanding Comedy Ensemble for his work in Sex and the City. As

                     back 7 generations. Since 8 years old she has been in front of audiences performing:
                     be it singing, dancing, or acting. Her true love of theater began when she was 14
                     years old at the New Orleans Recreational Department Theater under the program's long-time,
                     late director, Ty Tracy. After receiving her BFA in Performance Art from UL Lafayette,
                     she went to New York in higher pursuits. She continued her studies participating in
                     a five week program studying acting in affiliation with NYU. That summer, Dana saw
                     Shakespeare in the Park's Twelfth Night, which inspired her. At the end of the program
                     and with no place to live, Dana made the bold decision to stay in New York. Eventually
                     she found a tiny studio in Spanish Harlem, waited tables, auditioned, gigged, did
                     background vocals, and even taught theater at a community center in Brooklyn. Dana
                     has performed and also produced original work at: The Red Room Theater, Birdland,
                     Lennox Lounge, Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater, Under St. Mark's, The Cherry Lane Theater,
                     Summer Stages in Central Park, and La Mama Theater. At La Mama Theater, Dana was apart
                     of a project called Soulagraphie: a series of plays about genocide written by renowned
                     playwright Eric Ehn. She played the title character Maria Kizito: a play about a Rwandan
                     Nun that was tried and convicted of aiding in the death of thousands. In 2010, Dana
                     completed her MFA in Acting from the reputable California Institute of the Arts, where
                     she was in two world premieres and a long list of other full theatrical productions
                     both Classic and Contemporary. Upon graduating, she came straight home and broke into
                     Hollywood South, as Film and Television were also her great loves. Dana had one goal
                     when deciding to move back home; it was to be on HBO's Treme; the David Simon executively
                     produced show about her hometown. Not only was she on it, but she landed a recurring
                     role. Since then Dana has worked with some of Hollywood's biggest Academy Award Winners
                     and Nominees. It all began when she landed the role of Cora in Winner Quentin Tarantino's
                     Django Unchained. She felt so welcomed and connected to Quentin. She pitched ideas
                     about her character to him, including a song for the funeral scene, which was shot,
                     but would eventually land on the cutting room floor. Her next endeavor was working
                     with Nominee Lee Daniels' on his film, The Butler. She portrayed the role of Helen
                     Holloway, wife of James Holloway, played by Lenny Kravitz. Additionally, Dana has
                     worked directly with Academy Award Winners and Nominees: Angela Bassett, Leonardo
                     DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Woody Harrelson, Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica
                     Lang, Christoph Waltz, Forest Whitaker, and Oprah Winfrey! Dana considers herself
                     Tri-Costal, but currently resides in New Orleans, which will always be home.</span></td>

                     Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Foxx. Galicia has garnered much buzz around the character
                     she plays "Sheba," DiCaprio's love interest and since, she has been extremely well
                     received in the fashion industry, with her photos running in Page Six, W and online
                     fashion sites, noting her exceptional taste in clothing, versatile hairstyles among
                     other trending aspects of her looks. Born in Panama and raised in New York, Galicia
                     focused on her brains, not beauty. Nevertheless by high school, this girl with a 183
                     IQ, had rapidly evolved into a striking and vivacious young woman inexorably caught
                     up in the highly competitive fashion industry. To date, Galicia's modeling credits
                     include ad campaigns for: The Gap, Pepsi, Neutrogena and Hanes. Additionally, her
                     unique face has graced the pages of GQ, Vogue and Elle magazines. Recently she was
                     in an edgy shoot for W magazine with Tarantino promoting their film. After conquering
                     the modeling world, Galicia discovered a new passion in acting. She starred alongside
                     Cuba Gooding Jr, Hill Harper and Oliver Platt, to name a few When Galicia is not modeling
                     or acting she devotes her time to charities focused on developing the esteem and confidence
                     of youth. Nichole actively serves on the board of the Junior Committee of the New
                     York Center for Children; a charity dedicated to raising awareness and fighting child
                     abuse. As a sports fan, Galicia enjoys the power and fury of Formula One Racing. Even
                     more fascinating however is Nichole's taste for art. Her favorite artist is Diego
                     Velazquez and favorite museum is the Prado in Madrid. In fact, she owns dozens of
                     engravings and serigraphs, a few of which appear in a book she wrote called "Equipo
                     Cronica: The Nichole Kent Collection." It is named as such, as she sourced all of
                     the works with the help of her mentor Kent Alessandro. Nichole owns all of the Equipo
                     Cronica works discussed in the book. In her spare time, she visits art galleries,
                     the web and private collections looking for new Equipo Cronicas. She maintains a residence

                     							Biographie :<br>Escalante Lundy is an American film and television actor and producer, from New Orleans,
                     LA. His most notable role is as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's Oscar-Nominated
                     film, Django Unchained. Lundy also appears as a prison guard in HBO's Emmy-Nominated
                     television series Treme and in a Pampers commercial with Super Bowl Championship Quarterback,
                     New Orleans Saints' Drew Brees. Escalante Lundy was born in New Orleans, LA the eldest
                     of five brothers, to Merline (nee' Roy), retired real estate agent, of Rayne, LA,
                     and Hughes Banks Lundy, a salesman from Innis, LA. Lundy graduated from St. Augustine
                     High School, later receiving his Bachelor's degree in Urban Planning from the University
                     of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Lundy received Masters degrees in Urban Planning
                     and Geographic Information Systems from the University of New Orleans. Escalante's
                     career began as a stage producer in Sacramento, CA. When an actor failed to show-up,
                     Lundy took the role', garnered success and later decided to focus on acting as a career
                     path. Admittedly, shy by nature, Lundy used acting as a tool to face his fears of
                     public speaking and improve his diction. He continued to hone his acting skills by
                     taking parts in small productions in film and on-stage in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
                     Lundy returned to New Orleans in 2005, leaving his position with the California Department
                     of Transportation in Sacramento. Lundy's family members were victims of Hurricane
                     Katrina and his valiant character motivated him to permanently relocate. As the city
                     began to rebuild, Lundy continued to pursue his new found acting passions including
                     focusing on film roles. He studied with renowned acting coaches Veleka Grey (Young
                     and the Restless), Lance Nichols (Curious Case of Benjamin Button and HBO Television
                     Series, Treme) and became a fixture at the acclaimed Jerry Katz Joint (Ivana Chubback
                     Technique). In 2007, Lundy joined the made his New Orleans theatrical debut as co-lead
                     in the production of the "Papaya Man" with the Anthony Bean Community Theater (ABCT)in
                     New Orleans. After having a challenging first rehearsal Lundy says, "I tried to quit
                     but Mr. Bean wouldn't let me. He gave me legs until I was able to run" In 2012, Lundy
                     made his major motion picture debut as "Big Fred" in Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti
                     western, Django Unchained. Lundy's role as a Mandingo fighter reflects the contrast
                     of the powerlessness of slavery against the super human strength it took to survive
                     such atrocities. Additionally, the grueling fight scenes Lundy appears in are riveting.
                     Although filming the scenes was long and arduous, the efforts paid off. Tarantino
                     directed Lundy in some of the most memorable aspects of the film.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>Best known for his starring role as Det. Sonny Crockett on the hugely successful TV
                     series _"Miami Vice" (1984)_ (qv), Don Johnson is one of the stars who really defined
                     the 1980s. As James "Sonny" Crockett he went toe-to-toe with drug dealers, pimps,
                     prostitutes, assassins, illegal arms-dealers and crooked cops on a weekly basis from
                     1984 to 1989, appearing in a grand total of 110 episodes. The show, which was executive-produced
                     by four time Oscar-nominated director, producer and writer 'Michael Mann (I)' (qv),
                     paired Johnson with the equally cool 'Philip Michael Thomas' (qv) as Det. Ricardo
                     Tubbs and the calm and stoic presence of 'Edward James Olmos' (qv) as Lt. Martin Castillo.
                     It revolutionized television with its modern fashion, pop music, unique style and
                     use of real locations. Johnson typically wore $1000 Armani, Versace and Hugo Boss
                     suits over pastel cotton T-shirts, drove a Ferrari 365 GTS/4 Daytona (later a Ferrari
                     Testarossa) and lived on an Endeavour 42-foot sailboat named "St. Vitus' Dance" with
                     his pet alligator Elvis. He also had full use of an offshore powerboat. Still, "Miami
                     Vice" had not only style but substance, and his portrayal of the Vietnam veteran turned
                     vice detective turned Sonny Crockett into the world's favorite cop. For his work on
                     "Miami Vice" Johnson won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series
                     in 1986, and was nominated in the same category a year later. He also picked up an
                     Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1985. Johnson was
                     born in Flat Creek, Missouri, the son of a farmer and a beautician. As a kid he wanted
                     to become a professional bowler. Later, after a few brushes with the law at a young
                     age, he discovered acting. After working on the stage for a while he ventured into
                     films and television, but was not able to break into stardom despite, among other
                     things, starring in the sci-fi cult classic _A Boy and His Dog (1975)_ (qv). During
                     the late 1960s and early 70s, Johnson had two short-lived marriages that were annulled;
                     the names of his first two wives have never been made public. 'Tippi Hedren' (qv),
                     Johnson's co-star in _The Harrad Experiment (1973)_ (qv), allowed him to date her
                     daughter 'Melanie Griffith' (qv) despite the fact that she was only 14 and he was
                     22; the relationship culminated in a six-month marriage during 1976. In the 1980s
                     he lived with actress 'Patti D'Arbanville' (qv) and they had one son together. He
                     remarried Griffith in 1989, but divorced in 1996 when she left him for 'Antonio Banderas'
                     (qv). Johnson has been married to fifth wife Kelly Phleger since 1999, and they have
                     three children together. Johnson starred in four failed TV pilots before landing his
                     career-high role on "Miami Vice", which propelled him to superstardom. He directed
                     four highly praised episodes of the show, one of them co-starring Melanie Griffith.
                     He balanced his work on the series by appearing in the critically acclaimed TV film
                     _The Long Hot Summer (1985) (TV)_ (qv), an adaptation of the 'William Faulkner (I)'
                     (qv) novel, and the film _Sweet Hearts Dance (1988)_ (qv) with 'Susan Sarandon' (qv).
                     After the series ended he focused solely on his film career. Although movies like
                     _Dead Bang (1989)_ (qv), _The Hot Spot (1990)_ (qv) and _Harley Davidson and the Marlboro
                     Man (1991)_ (qv) did not fare well with the critics, quite a few of them have obtained
                     a considerable cult following, with fans praising them as all being quality contributions
                     to their genre. His film work has given Johnson the opportunity to work with legendary
                     filmmakers like 'John Frankenheimer' (qv), 'Sidney Lumet' (qv) and 'Dennis Hopper'
                     (qv). After working steadily, Johnson returned to TV in 1996 with the cop show _"Nash
                     Bridges" (1996)_ (qv). The show, which Johnson created and produced, did very well.
                     It co-starred 'Cheech Marin' (qv) and 'Jodi Lyn O'Keefe' (qv). Johnson played the

                     convertible. After "Nash Bridges" went off the air Johnson kept a low profile, but
                     continues to appear in films and on television. He starred in the failed WB courtroom
                     drama _"Just Legal" (2005)_ (qv), which was produced by 'Jerry Bruckheimer' (qv),
                     and has traveled to Europe to make such films as the Norwegian screwball comedy _Lange

                     a vivere da solo (2008)_ (qv). He will soon be seen in the romantic comedy _When in

                     							Biographie :<br>Franco Nero, a leading actor in international cinema, was born in Parma (Northern
                     Italy). His inclination for acting had already become obvious in his teenage years
                     when he began organizing and participating in student plays. After a short stint at
                     a leading theater school, he moved to Rome where he joined a small group of friends
                     for the purpose of making some documentaries. Still unsure of his ultimate vocation,
                     he worked various jobs on the crew. The role as Abel in John Houston's film "The Bible"
                     marked a crucial point in his career. A few months later he had his big break with
                     the internationally acclaimed cult-classic Spaghetti-Western "Django". The following
                     year Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of "Camelot" (Warner Bros.), opposite
                     Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award. Nero has appeared
                     in more than 195 movies around the world and has worked with Europe's top directors,
                     such as Luis Bunuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, Sergei Bondarciuk,
                     Michael Cacoyannis, Elio Petri, Marco Bellocchio, Enzo G. Castellari, just to mention
                     a few. He has also payed the roles of leading national heroes, such as "Garibaldi"
                     (Italy), "Arpad" (Hungary", "Banovic Strahinja" (Yugoslavia). In the USA he has been
                     in successful mini-series such as "The Pirate" (Warner Bros), "The Last Days of Pompeii"
                     (CBS), "Young Catherine" (TNT), "Bella Mafia" (CBS), "The Painted Lady", "Saint Augustine",
                     and movies such as "The Legend of Valentino", "21 Hours to Munich", "Force 10 from
                     Navarone", "Enter the Ninja", "The Versace Murder", "Die Hard 2", and recently "Letters
                     to Juliet". At the beginning of the 80's, he also began producing, writing and directing.
                     Between films, he participates in various theatrical events. Over the last 45 years
                     he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli. He has received many
                     awards and in 1992 for his artistic merits a knighthood of the Italian Republic was
                     bestowed on him by the President of Italy. In 2011 he was honored by Brunel University
                     of London with the honorary degree of doctor of Letters honoris causa and in Toronto
                     with a star on the walk of fame.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>A Manhattan-born character player who attended New York University, actor James Russo
                     wrote and starred in a prize-winning short film, "The Candy Store", while attending
                     college. His first big film break was as a convenience store robber in _Fast Times
                     at Ridgemont High (1982)_ (qv). Possessed with a stare that can bring shivers down
                     one's back, he has been quite the accessible villain over the years, memorably portraying
                     a number of gritty psychopaths and gangsters, among other undesirables. Surprisingly,
                     Russo is not a name or commodity, yet an intense and dependable "tough guy" performer
                     he has proven to be. One only needs to be reminded of his sadistic sexual animal role
                     in "Extremities" on stage (in which he won a 1983 Theatre World) and in film (in which
                     he terrorized 'Farrah Fawcett' (qv)), to recall how chillingly effective he can be.
                     Other decent roles in films include 'Kevin Costner' (qv)'s _The Postman (1997)_ (qv)
                     and _Open Range (2003)_ (qv), plus _Beverly Hills Cop (1984)_ (qv), _We're No Angels
                     (1989)_ (qv), _Donnie Brasco (1997)_ (qv), _No Way Home (1996)_ (qv), and a number
                     of low-budget crimers. On stage, he has "Welcome to Andromeda", "Deathwatch", "Marat/Sade"
                     and the afore-mentioned "Extremities" to his credit. Russo appeared opposite 'Johnny
                     Depp' (qv) in 'Roman Polanski' (qv)'s _The Ninth Gate (1999)_ (qv), and portrayed
                     mobster "Victor Mura" in TV's short-lived, _"Falcone" (2000)_ (qv), the following
                     year. More recently, he offered a penetrating cameo as 'Frank Sinatra' (qv) in _Stealing

                     							Biographie :<br>He'll forever be remembered as strapping, good ol' boy Luke Duke, the virile, blue-eyed,
                     dark-haired, plaid-shirted rascal (equally good-looking 'John Schneider (I)' (qv)
                     was the strapping, plaid-shirted blond cousin) on the rough-and-tumble bucolic 80s
                     series _"The Dukes of Hazzard" (1979)_ (qv). Where others may have fallen by the TV
                     wayside, however, after the cancellation of such a popular series, Wopat moved on
                     and reverted back to his first true love - music - successfully refocusing as a recording
                     artist and musical leading man of Broadway and regional shows. The highly engaging
                     Wisconsin native was born one of six brothers and sisters to a dairy farmer in 1951.
                     Tom began singing and dancing in school musicals from age 12 and, following high school
                     graduation, decided to avidly pursue music as a viable profession. Studying at the
                     University of Wisconsin he dropped out to front a rock band as both guitarist and
                     lead singer, and later gained on-stage experience in such musicals as "South Pacific",
                     "West Side Story" and "Jesus Christ Superstar". Appearing off-Broadway in 1978 before
                     making his Broadway debut that same year as a replacement actor in the musical "I
                     Love My Wife", other book shows came his way including "The Robber Bridegroom" and
                     the lead in "Oklahoma!" With solid, down-home good looks and appeal, it didn't take
                     long for Hollywood to check him out. By 1979 Tom was co-starring in (and later sometimes
                     directing) episodes of his own popular action-packed series while he and Schneider
                     wrangled heartthrob status in the teen magazines. The backwoods show lasted six seasons,
                     although at one point he and Schneider left the series after contract negotiations
                     broke down. Briefly replaced, the show wasn't the same without them and they eventually
                     were brought back. During the show's run, Tom kick-started his recording career with
                     his first (and self-titled) country album release in 1983. His output went on to include
                     six other country albums before finally releasing a 2000 album of standard love songs.
                     After the end of his series, Wopat made do in a couple of mini-movie vehicles and
                     a few short-lived series before scoring again on TV as 'Cybill Shepherd' (qv)' ex-husband/stuntman
                     on her own sitcom series in 1995. Better yet, he resharpened his musical theater skills.
                     He returned with commanding baritone leads in "Carousel" (1986), "City of Angels"
                     (1990) and "Guys and Dolls" (1992) (as Skye Masterson). In 1999 he recreated the sharp-shooting
                     Frank Butler role opposite 'Bernadette Peters' (qv) in the popular Broadway revival
                     of "Annie Get Your Gun" and earned a Tony nomination in the process. It's only gotten
                     sweeter. Guesting for the Cincinnati Symphony and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras
                     in programs featuring Broadway's finest music, he has continued on the New York stage
                     with successive roles in "42nd Street" and "Chicago" (as slick lawyer Billy Flynn).
                     In 2005 he more than held his own in his first straight-acting Broadway part as part
                     of the excellent ensemble in the Tony-winning (for "Best Revival of a Play") production
                     of "Glengarry Glen Ross" starring acting heavyweights 'Alan Alda' (qv) and 'Liev Schreiber'
                     (qv). That same year Wopat embarked on a 33-date national "Over The Rainbow" tour
                     with 'Faith Prince' (qv) featuring the gorgeous songs of 'Harold Arlen' (qv), a tour
                     that included Carnegie Hall.</span></td>

                     and his mother, Ann, owned and operated the popular "Embers Steak House" and nightclub
                     where Ann performed nightly. Don thrived on the beach in Waikiki under the watchful
                     eyes of such mentors as Blackout, Mud, Buckshot, Rabbit and Steamboat. He learned
                     much from these famous beach boys and in 1960, at the age of 17, he placed fourth
                     in the "Duke Kahanamoku World Surfing Championship" at Makaha, Hawaii. Don was surfing
                     at Waikiki when he was discovered. Actor 'Troy Donahue' (qv) was filming _"Hawaiian

                     he decided to go to Hollywood to give it a try. Upon arriving in L.A., he landed a
                     variety of jobs, including parking cars, bouncer and then manager of the world famous
                     "Whiskey A Go-Go" nightclub on the Sunset Strip, where such greats as 'Janis Joplin'

                     linked to the "womb to tomb" role of Riff, the knife-wielding, rocket-tempered, Baryshnikov-styled
                     gang leader of the streetwise Jets in the musical film masterpiece _West Side Story
                     (1961)_ (qv), it's not a bad way to be remembered! Russ was actually 27 when he portrayed
                     the teenage troublemaker who became the '50s equivalent of the Mercutio character
                     in the Romeo and Juliet-inspired adaptation. To describe Tamblyn as talented and extremely
                     agile is a huge understatement. This awesome musical performer was born in Los Angeles,
                     California on December 30, 1934, and groomed early for stardom. Discovered at age
                     ten by actor 'Lloyd Bridges (I)' (qv) for the play "Stone Jungle", Russ was soon performing
                     on radio and in L.A.-based musical revues. Billed as "Rusty Tamblyn" then, the tousle-haired
                     scrapper played a student extra in his first film _The Boy with Green Hair (1948)_
                     (qv) starring another child actor, 'Dean Stockwell' (qv). Having taken up dancing
                     and acrobatics from the age of 6, Tamblyn marked his abilities with his very first
                     TV appearance on the "The Ed Sullivan Show." Eventually handed a starring role in
                     the "B" film _The Kid from Cleveland (1949)_ (qv), he was signed by an eager MGM who
                     saw his potential as a juvenile actor. Featured in the popular family-oriented comedy
                     _Father of the Bride (1950)_ (qv), and its sequel _Father's Little Dividend (1951)_
                     (qv), Tamblyn also had a prime role in the war drama _Take the High Ground! (1953)_
                     (qv) before taking off in musical films. Demonstrating exceptional athleticism in
                     one of MGM's best, _Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)_ (qv), Tamblyn's timing
                     was regrettably off as musicals were quickly on the wane. He adjusted, however. A
                     starring role in the low-budget _The Young Guns (1956)_ (qv) led to excellent reviews
                     in the ensemble box-office soaper _Peyton Place (1957)_ (qv). Tamblyn, along with
                     'Lana Turner' (qv), 'Arthur Kennedy (I)' (qv), 'Hope Lange' (qv) and 'Diane Varsi'
                     (qv), all received Oscar nominations for their participation. Russ scored quite well
                     in the title role of _tom thumb (1958)_ (qv), which became a large stepping stone
                     in his being cast as Riff in 1961. Following this achievement, however, the offers
                     started dwindling. Tamblyn's last co-starring roles in quality films were shot overseas
                     with the British-produced chiller _The Haunting (1963)_ (qv) with 'Julie Harris (I)'
                     (qv) and 'Claire Bloom (I)' (qv), and the British-Yugoslavian Viking costumer _The
                     Long Ships (1964)_ (qv) starring 'Richard Widmark' (qv) and 'Sidney Poitier' (qv).
                     After that, his career grew quite dismal. Titles such as _The Female Bunch (1971)_
                     (qv), _Satan's Sadists (1969)_ (qv), _Scream Free! (1969)_ (qv), _Dracula vs. Frankenstein
                     (1971)_ (qv) and _Blood Screams (1990)_ (qv) pretty much tells the story. On the road
                     in the lean years with minor stage productions here and there, including the musical
                     "Cabaret," Russ all but disappeared from the viewing audience. When he finally nabbed
                     the role of the overtly weird (and who wasn't on that show?) psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence
                     Jacoby in the popular TV cult series _"Twin Peaks" (1990)_ (qv), it was the first
                     time Tamblyn had generated interest in over two decades. Barely recognizable with
                     his wild-eyed look, mangy hair and frizzy beard, he has since gained employment off
                     this eccentric image. Married three times, Tamblyn has lately taken on choreographic
                     duties and the managing of actress/daughter 'Amber Tamblyn' (qv)'s career, she of
                     _"Joan of Arcadia" (2003)_ (qv) fame.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>Bruce Dern had established himself as the movies' premier heavy, playing sociopaths,
                     psychotics and just plain criminals by the time he was nominated for an Academy Award
                     for Best Supporting Actor for _Coming Home (1978)_ (qv). Some perceptive critics had
                     noted that Dern was a finer actor than his roles generally allowed one to believe,
                     repelled as one was by the neurotic persona that Dern was able to project and that
                     casting directors capitalized on. 'Jack Nicholson (I)' (qv), a close friend, claimed
                     that Dern was the best of the new breed of actors who had been born just before World
                     War II and were coming into their own in the 1970s. Unlike his screen image, Dern
                     had come from a patrician background: his grandfather had been governor of Utah and
                     a secretary of war under 'Franklin D. Roosevelt' (qv). When allowed to step out of
                     his on-screen persona to assay the millionaire Tom Buchanan in the 1974 remake of
                     _The Great Gatsby (1974)_ (qv), he acquitted himself quite well. Some critics said
                     that "Gatsby" would have been better if Dern rather than 'Robert Redford (I)' (qv)
                     had played the title role. Others pointed to his fine work as Nicholson's brother
                     in _The King of Marvin Gardens (1972)_ (qv) to establish a case that he was an underappreciated
                     and underutilized talent. By the time Dern appeared as the cuckolded Marine in "Coming
                     Home," a consensus had emerged that Dern was a fine actor. He won an Oscar nod for
                     the role, then fell victim to the infamous "Oscar curse" that has claimed other winners,
                     most famously in the case of 1969 Best Supporting Actor winner 'Gig Young' (qv), Dern's
                     co-star in _They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969)_ (qv). Dern, like Young before him,
                     was determined to break out of supporting roles. Like Young, who had been cast repeatedly
                     as a light comedian in his career, Dern had also become typecast, but as a psycho,
                     surpassing even 'Anthony Perkins (I)' (qv) in those types of roles. Dern was determined
                     to break out of the ghetto he had found himself in before "Coming Home." He failed,
                     and his career suffered. Up through his Oscar nomination, Dern had starred in 26 films
                     in 11 years since graduating to steady employment in A-pictures with _Waterhole #3
                     (1967)_ (qv). After the 1979 Oscar nod, he would appear in only a dozen feature films
                     in the next 11 years, not counting TV movies. None of them brought him stardom or
                     much acclaim, and his attempt at becoming a lead man, _Middle Age Crazy (1980)_ (qv),
                     flopped badly (he did received a nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor
                     at the 1981 Genie Awards, the Canadian equivalent of the Oscars, for his work in that
                     picture). It was back to psychos, this time as a lead, in _Tattoo (1981)_ (qv). The
                     movie proved to be another flop, and his reputation was further damaged when he bragged
                     that he had actually performed on-screen sexual intercourse with co-star 'Maud Adams'
                     (qv), a boast that Adams heatedly denied. Dern's star was seriously dimmed. Although
                     he landed a coveted role in the film adaptation of 'Jason Miller (I)' (qv)'s Pulitzer
                     Prize-winning play _That Championship Season (1982)_ (qv), the film was a disappointment
                     with critics and at the box office. He turned in a fine performance three years later
                     in the TV movie _Toughlove (1985) (TV)_ (qv), but overall, his career was floundering.
                     Another psycho role, that of Uncle Bud in _After Dark, My Sweet (1990)_ (qv), started
                     buzz about another possible Best Supporting Oscar nod for him, but the film proved
                     a box-office bust and the nomination never materialized. A predicted career renaissance
                     for Dern faded, just as the careers of his ex-wife, 'Diane Ladd' (qv), and their daughter,
                     'Laura Dern' (qv), kicked into high gear. Since the 1990 high point of the second
                     wave of his career, Dern has stayed steadily employed, but has never again generated
                     much critical acclaim, nor made any inroads towards reclaiming his crown as the cinema's
                     premier sociopath. A fine actor, who will be remembered most vividly for such psycho/killer
                     roles such as the rustler leader who gunned down 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) in _The Cowboys
                     (1972)_ (qv), Dern's career serves as a cautionary tale for those actors who try to
                     escape the ghetto of typecasting. While nothing restricts an actor's artistic development
                     as much as typecasting, unless like a Duke Wayne they can turn that type into superstardom,
                     trying to break out of the type can prove to be career suicide.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>As an established and extremely talented stunt double, Zoe Bell has made a name for
                     herself through her unparalleled dedication, skills, and focus. Bell debuts her acting
                     career, with her already famous stunt skills, in the highly anticipated double feature
                     _Grindhouse (2007)_ (qv) written by 'Quentin Tarantino' (qv) and 'Robert Rodriguez
                     (I)' (qv). She was hand picked, by Tarentino himself, to star in his segment of the
                     double feature, Death Proof, about four women working on the movie set of their next
                     big hit. All seems to be going well on set until a psychotic killer begins to stalk
                     them. Bell began working with Tarantino well before Grindhouse hough, in _Kill Bill:
                     Vol. 1 (2003)_ (qv) and _Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)_ (qv) playing the stunt double for
                     Uma Thurman's role, The Bride. Bell was nominated for her work in Kill Bill, Vol.
                     1 in the categories of Best Stunt by a Stunt Woman and Best Fight for the Taurus World
                     Stunt Awards, both of which she would win the following year for Kill Bill: Vol. 2.
                     Bell also showed off her stunt-woman skills as a double for Sharon Stone in Halle
                     Barry's _Catwoman (2004)_ (qv). Bell's talent can not only be seen on the big screen
                     but also in the cult television series _"Xena: Warrior Princess" (1995)_ (qv) where
                     she was the stunt double for Lucy Lawless. Bell also appeared as a double in the ABC
                     thriller _"Alias" (2001)_ (qv) and on an episode of Cleopatra 2525 in 2000 as a double
                     for Vicki Pratti. In the action packed documentary _Double Dare (2004)_ (qv), Bell
                     along with legendary stunt-woman 'Jeannie Epper' (qv) give an insight into the career
                     of women who take falls and punches for a living. Double Dare also gives a glimpse
                     into the struggles of stunt-women to stay thin, employed, and sane in a male dominated
                     career. Bell, a native of New Zealand, currently resides in Los Angeles but hopes
                     to someday own a home in New Zealand.</span></td>

                     directors Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles, Robert Rodriguez, Kevin Smith and David
                     Lynch. His career of over twenty years and his love for acting was inspired by his
                     father, veteran actor Michael Parks, and began with classical training and work in
                     Shakespearean theater. He has since worked consistently in film, television and theater,
                     appearing most notably in "Kill Bill: Vol.1," "Amigo," "The Listening" and in episodes
                     of "Deadwood" (pilot), "True Blood" and a number of other popular TV series. He stars
                     alongside Caroline Goodall in "The Elevator," an English-language suspense film shot
                     in Rome by Italian director Massimo Cogliotore. James is also a writer for film and

                     							Biographie :<br>Pittsburgh-born actor/SFX wizard/stuntman/director Tom Savini did a tour of duty as
                     a combat cameraman in Vietnam, and has since acquired a remarkable cult following
                     among film fans, primarily due to his ground-breaking SFX in the "splatter movie"
                     explosion of the early 1980s. Along with fellow special make-up legends 'Dick Smith
                     (II)' (qv) and 'Rob Bottin' (qv), Savini was one of the key SFX people behind the
                     startling make-up &amp; EFX seen in the fantasy/horror genre films of the 1980s-'90s.
                     Savini was heavily influenced by the remarkable silent-era actor 'Lon Chaney' (qv),
                     and he sought to emulate the amazing theatrical make-up effects that were a hallmark
                     of Chaney's career. In Savini's insightful book "Grande Illusions", he speaks of his
                     early attempts at applying prosthetics to his face using "spearmint gum", having misinterpreted
                     that he was meant to actually use "spirit gum"! His first work was in low-budget fare,
                     providing SFX and make-up for independently made horror films such as _Deranged (1974)_
                     (qv) and _Martin (1976)_ (qv). However, he really caught the attention of horror buffs
                     with his grisly effects in the cult 'George A. Romero (I)' (qv)-directed zombie film
                     _Dawn of the Dead (1978)_ (qv), and then in the controversial slasher film _Friday
                     the 13th (1980)_ (qv), the movie generally identified as the kickstart for the aforementioned
                     "splatter movie" genre. Savini also contributed the incredible EFX &amp; make-up to other
                     splatter thrillers such as _Maniac (1980)_ (qv), _The Burning (1981)_ (qv), _Creepshow
                     (1982)_ (qv) and Romero's third "Dead" film, _Day of the Dead (1985)_ (qv) (for which
                     he won a Saturn Award). In 1990, Savini directed his feature film debut _Night of
                     the Living Dead (1990)_ (qv), the remake of the original zombie-classic. Not content
                     with just being behind the lens, however, Savini has appeared in dozens of films,
                     and can be seen demonstrating his capable acting skills as "Morgan, the Black Knight"
                     in _Knightriders (1981)_ (qv), as "Blades", one of the biker gang members in _Dawn
                     of the Dead (1978)_ (qv) and as "Sex Machine", another leather-clad biker--but this
                     time with a groin-mounted gun--in the wild vampire film _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_
                     (qv).</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>In January of 1992, _Reservoir Dogs (1992)_ (qv) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival,
                     by first-time writer-director Quentin Tarantino. The film garnered critical acclaim
                     and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs
                     success with _Pulp Fiction (1994)_ (qv) which premiered at the Cannes film festival,
                     winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated
                     for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing
                     partner 'Roger Avary' (qv) came away with the award only for best original screenplay.
                     In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology _Four Rooms (1995)_ (qv) with
                     friends and fellow auteurs 'Alexandre Rockwell' (qv), 'Robert Rodriguez (I)' (qv)
                     and 'Allison Anders' (qv). The film opened on December 25th in the United States to
                     very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was _From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)_ (qv), a
                     vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with 'George Clooney' (qv). The
                     film did fairly well theatrically.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>William Hudson, an American actor from Chicago, is the son of Michael Hudson, a popular
                     radio disc jockey on Chicago's number one urban station, WGCI 107.5. William attended
                     St. Ignatius high school on West Roosevelt Rd. and played varsity basketball for the
                     Wolfpack. His love and talent for the game ended him up at The University of Miami
                     with the Hurricanes, however after just one year he decided to focus on entertainment
                     instead. While on a trip to New York City in the summer of 2007 visiting friends of
                     the family, Hudson found himself in the borough of Brooklyn at the exact same time
                     as the academy award winning director, Ridley Scott was filming the 1970's based major
                     motion picture, "American Gangster." Wearing his hair braided in cornrows at the time,
                     Hudson decided to take them out and approach Mr. Scott with his own 70's style afro
                     and ambition. Seeing the determination in Mr. Hudson's eyes and the hairstyle befitting
                     of the period piece, Ridley decided to include William in the film as a drug dealer
                     alongside fellow Chicago native and actor, "Common Sense." With the successful major
                     motion picture, "American Gangster" under his belt, Mr. Hudson then found himself
                     in Los Angeles, California on an audition for another period piece to be directed
                     by yet another academy award winning director, Quentin Tarantino. The movie was "Django
                     Unchained," and the role was that of the character named, "Blueberry," a slave turned
                     killer deep in the woods of Texas in the year 1861. "Django Unchained" went on the
                     be Mr. Tarantino's highest grossing film to date. Mr. Hudson still lives in Chicago
                     Illinois.</span></td>

                     Sign Language, and conversational French. She is a classical/Opera singer and has
                     5 siblings, including a Deaf older brother. Her parents came to the United States
                     during the 1980s in search of a better future. Years later, she was their first child
                     to be born in America. Born and raised in Florida, Pierre-Louis ended up meeting her
                     three older siblings, who were all born in Haiti, for the first time by the age of
                     6. She discovered her love of acting after performing a Langston Hughes poem in the
                     6th grade. That following year she was accepted into a performing arts middle/high
                     school (Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr. School of the Arts)that changed her life forever.
                     Pierre-Louis went on to performing in churches, community theaters, schools, and various
                     programs to positively impact inner city youth. She is also an avid reader, and actively
                     involved within the Deaf community.</span></td>

                     							Biographie :<br>J.D. was born in the delta town of Greenville, Mississippi (also the birthplace of
                     Muppets creator Jim Henson) on the same day Richard Nixon was elected president. He
                     is of Irish-French-German-Cherokee-Choctaw decent, the oldest of 7 siblings, and attended
                     17 different schools (public and private) while moving back and forth between his
                     mother and father. His great-great-great-great uncle was Horace Mann, the founder
                     of the American Public School system. His father (Puddin - yep, that's what they call
                     him) is a welder/artist/amateur archaeologist and inventor. His mother (Sally) has
                     had many professions, including concert promoter and owner of a country/western nightclub
                     called The Headless Horseman, where as a young child, J.D. spent many school nights
                     until the wee hours of the morning hanging out backstage and on stage with the likes
                     of Hank Williams, Jr., Juice Newton, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Paycheck, David Allen
                     Coe, Ray Price, and many others. After a short stint in college and a 15 month stint
                     in the Marine Corps stationed at 29 Palms, California and after hanging out with some
                     actors in L.A., J.D. thought he would give acting a shot. His only experience with
                     acting had been playing the Prince in his pre-school production of The Nutcracker,
                     and getting kicked out of his senior play, Oklahoma, after his second rehearsal because
                     he and a friend drank a beer before hand. After the Marine Corps, he returned to Mississippi
                     and worked as a debt collector for his mother's collection agency. After a year of
                     hating his job, he decided to return to college and get a degree in theatre at The
                     University of Southern Mississippi. Once on stage at college, he knew acting was what
                     he had to do. His second year in theatre, he was one of 20 finalists in the state
                     selected to attend SETC (Southeastern Theatre Conference). In 1995, a friend offered
                     J.D. a $1,000 to come to Los Angeles and perform a lead role in his play "Dylan's
                     Ghost" at the Morgan-Wixson Theatre in Santa Monica. J.D. took him up on the offer
                     and left college a semester before graduating and since then has lived back and forth
                     between Hollywood, California, Austin, Texas, and Oxford, Mississippi, where he just
                     completed writing and directing his first independent feature _Glorious Mail(2005)_.
                     Even though he appeared on the short-lived game show, Hollywood Showdown with Todd
                     Newton and won nearly $12,000, his friends like to tell him that he's almost one lucky
                     son of a gun. Mainly because he's come so close to landing lead roles in major films
                     so many times, usually being the director's second choice. In 2004 his luck proved
                     true once again when he purchased a $100 raffle ticket and was 1st Runner Up (2nd
                     Choice) for a $250,000 house in United Way's New Home Giveaway, where instead he won
                     an artist's print worth $80.</span></td>

                     'Steve McQueen (I)' (qv), John Wayne, Alan Ladd, Ward Bond, Lee Marvin and 'Robert
                     Mitchum' (qv) among those actors who both influenced and inspired him to be an actor.
                     Allen has appeared in over 50 film and television productions and considers himself
                     fortunate to have had the ability and opportunity to work in both film and television.
                     He is filming the inspirational sports drama, "My All American" written and directed
                     by Angelo Pizzo and most recently appeared in Quentin Tarantino's blockbuster Django
                     Unchained as a very Gary Cooper-eque (according to Tarantino) plantation overseer
                     named, "Dollar Bill." In another recent film, Allen completed a starring role in the
                     independent feature, _Frontera (2010)_ (qv), playing a tough, driven Texas Ranger
                     who brings down a powerful drug cartel. The film is yet to be released, but Allen
                     remains hopeful that it will find a market. Recent television appearances include
                     the NBC/Bruckheimer Pilot, _Chase (2010)_ (qv) and a recurring role on _"Friday Night
                     Lights" (2006)_ (qv). Allen also co-starred with 'Robert Duvall' (qv) in Duvall's
                     Academy Award-nominated film, _The Apostle (1997)_ (qv) and, more recently, co-starred
                     with Duvall again in AMC's Emmy Award-winning original mini-series, _"Broken Trail"
                     (2006)_ (qv), playing the well-reviewed role of "Marshal Bill Miller," a man who carries
                     severed human ears on his watch chain. In _American Identity (2007)_ (qv), Allen both
                     produced and co-starred as a battle-hardened Marine Master Sergeant, with a sly sense
                     of humor and a definite command of the battle field, in the deserts of Afghanistan.
                     Other career highlights include three films with 'Lawrence Kasdan' (qv), three films
                     with 'Kevin Costner' (qv), and playing fighter ace 'Chuck Yeager' (qv) in a Hallmark
                     Hall of Fame special presentation. He has many guest-starring roles on television,
                     including appearances on _"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (2000)_ (qv), _"NCIS: Naval
                     Criminal Investigative Service" (2003)_ (qv), _"Monk" (2002)_ (qv), and a movie for
                     Hallmark entitled _Claire (2007) (TV)_ (qv). Allen will launch an independent media
                     and production company in 2014 and has a number of exceptional feature film properties
                     and television projects in development. Among them are two film projects he plans
                     to direct. Allen has also written several highly regarded screenplays. His first screenplay,
                     a gritty, film-noir styled Western, "The Deserters", was the subject of much competition
                     among studios but Allen held the project for its original intent which was a starring
                     role for himself. Since Allen is now gray headed and has low back problems, he is
                     now considering directing the film rather than starring in it so he doesn't have to
                     do any more of his own stunts. Other well received screenplays include, "Suicide Grip,"
                     a romantic thrill ride set against the exciting backdrop of the National Finals Rodeo
                     in Las Vegas. "The Empty Quarter," is a cautionary tale set on an explosive gas well
                     in Saudi Arabia's most barren desert and "Rio Grande" is based on the best selling
                     memoir, One Ranger, which details the life and career of a legendary Texas Ranger
                     along the volatile Texas/Mexico border. Allen maintains residences in Los Angeles
                     and his hometown of Austin, Texas. Flight crews on Southwest Airlines love him.</span></td>
